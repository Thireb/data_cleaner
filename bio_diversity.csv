Abstract
"  Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease
related alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can
be made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the
subject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual
measurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely
used, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,
is rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of
dispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction
method, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive
modeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically
aims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite
sample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type
algorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic
manner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed
as a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are
estimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental
evaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on
synthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy
compared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the
ADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between
subject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score
and Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on
the longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when
RSM is used.

"  Rotation invariance and translation invariance have great values in image
recognition tasks. In this paper, we bring a new architecture in convolutional
neural network (CNN) named cyclic convolutional layer to achieve rotation
invariance in 2-D symbol recognition. We can also get the position and
orientation of the 2-D symbol by the network to achieve detection purpose for
multiple non-overlap target. Last but not least, this architecture can achieve
one-shot learning in some cases using those invariance.

"  Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra of samples from 7 plant species
were used to explore the influence of preprocessing and feature extraction on
efficiency of machine learning algorithms. Wavelet Tensor Train (WTT) and
Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) were compared as feature extraction
techniques for FTIR data of medicinal plants. Various combinations of signal
processing steps showed different behavior when applied to classification and
clustering tasks. Best results for WTT and DWT found through grid search were
similar, significantly improving quality of clustering as well as
classification accuracy for tuned logistic regression in comparison to original
spectra. Unlike DWT, WTT has only one parameter to be tuned (rank), making it a
more versatile and easier to use as a data processing tool in various signal
processing applications.

"  We present a systematic global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method
which can be utilized to rank the variables that affect two quantity of
interests -- pore pressure depletion and stress change -- around a
hydraulically-fractured horizontal well based on their degree of importance.
These variables include rock properties and stimulation design variables. A
fully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore
pressure and stress changes due to production. To ease the computational cost
of a simulator, we also provide reduced order models (ROMs), which can be used
to replace the complex numerical model with a rather simple analytical model,
for calculating the pore pressure and stresses at different locations around
hydraulic fractures. The main findings of this research are: (i) mobility,
production pressure, and fracture half-length are the main contributors to the
changes in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of
each parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic
fractures and the quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect
of mobility decreases and the effect of production pressure increases. (iii)
These two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses at large
distances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture
tips or inside the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and
half-length are the dominant factors that affect the minimum horizontal stress.
The results of this study will provide useful guidelines for the stimulation
design of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill
drilling.
"
"  The classical Eilenberg correspondence, based on the concept of the syntactic
monoid, relates varieties of regular languages with pseudovarieties of finite
monoids. Various modifications of this correspondence appeared, with more
general classes of regular languages on one hand and classes of more complex
algebraic structures on the other hand. For example, classes of languages need
not be closed under complementation or all preimages under homomorphisms, while
monoids can be equipped with a compatible order or they can have a
distinguished set of generators. Such generalized varieties and pseudovarieties
also have natural counterparts formed by classes of finite (ordered) automata.
In this paper the previous approaches are combined. The notion of positive
$\mathcal C$-varieties of ordered semiautomata (i.e. no initial and final
states are specified) is introduced and their correspondence with positive
$\mathcal C$-varieties of languages is proved.

"  The Fault Detection and Isolation Tools (FDITOOLS) is a collection of MATLAB
functions for the analysis and solution of fault detection and model detection
problems. The implemented functions are based on the computational procedures
described in the Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the book: ""A. Varga, Solving Fault
Diagnosis Problems - Linear Synthesis Techniques, Springer, 2017"". This
document is the User's Guide for the version V1.0 of FDITOOLS. First, we
present the mathematical background for solving several basic exact and
approximate synthesis problems of fault detection filters and model detection
filters. Then, we give in-depth information on the command syntax of the main
analysis and synthesis functions. Several examples illustrate the use of the
main functions of FDITOOLS.

"  Detectability of discrete event systems (DESs) is a question whether the
current and subsequent states can be determined based on observations. Shu and
Lin designed a polynomial-time algorithm to check strong (periodic)
detectability and an exponential-time (polynomial-space) algorithm to check
weak (periodic) detectability. Zhang showed that checking weak (periodic)
detectability is PSpace-complete. This intractable complexity opens a question
whether there are structurally simpler DESs for which the problem is tractable.
In this paper, we show that it is not the case by considering DESs represented
as deterministic finite automata without non-trivial cycles, which are
structurally the simplest deadlock-free DESs. We show that even for such very
simple DESs, checking weak (periodic) detectability remains intractable. On the
contrary, we show that strong (periodic) detectability of DESs can be
efficiently verified on a parallel computer.
"
"  We present a novel sound localization algorithm for a non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) sound source in indoor environments. Our approach exploits the
diffraction properties of sound waves as they bend around a barrier or an
obstacle in the scene. We combine a ray tracing based sound propagation
algorithm with a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model, which simulate
bending effects by placing a virtual sound source on a wedge in the
environment. We precompute the wedges of a reconstructed mesh of an indoor
scene and use them to generate diffraction acoustic rays to localize the 3D
position of the source. Our method identifies the convergence region of those
generated acoustic rays as the estimated source position based on a particle
filter. We have evaluated our algorithm in multiple scenarios consisting of a
static and dynamic NLOS sound source. In our tested cases, our approach can
localize a source position with an average accuracy error, 0.7m, measured by
the L2 distance between estimated and actual source locations in a 7m*7m*3m
room. Furthermore, we observe 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over a
state-of-the-art localization method that does not model diffraction effects,
especially when a sound source is not visible to the robot.

"  Large deep neural networks are powerful, but exhibit undesirable behaviors
such as memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. In this work, we
propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In
essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of
examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to
favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on
the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show
that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network
architectures. We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt
labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the
training of generative adversarial networks.

"  With recent advancements in drone technology, researchers are now considering
the possibility of deploying small cells served by base stations mounted on
flying drones. A major advantage of such drone small cells is that the
operators can quickly provide cellular services in areas of urgent demand
without having to pre-install any infrastructure. Since the base station is
attached to the drone, technically it is feasible for the base station to
dynamic reposition itself in response to the changing locations of users for
reducing the communication distance, decreasing the probability of signal
blocking, and ultimately increasing the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we
first propose distributed algorithms for autonomous control of drone movements,
and then model and analyse the spectral efficiency performance of a drone small
cell to shed new light on the fundamental benefits of dynamic repositioning. We
show that, with dynamic repositioning, the spectral efficiency of drone small
cells can be increased by nearly 100\% for realistic drone speed, height, and
user traffic model and without incurring any major increase in drone energy
consumption.

"  Artificial Neural Network computation relies on intensive vector-matrix
multiplications. Recently, the emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) crossbar array
showed a feasibility of implementing such operations with high energy
efficiency, thus there are many works on efficiently utilizing emerging NVM
crossbar array as analog vector-matrix multiplier. However, its nonlinear I-V
characteristics restrain critical design parameters, such as the read voltage
and weight range, resulting in substantial accuracy loss. In this paper,
instead of optimizing hardware parameters to a given neural network, we propose
a methodology of reconstructing a neural network itself optimized to resistive
memory crossbar arrays. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we
simulated various neural network with MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset using two
different specific Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) model. Simulation
results show that our proposed neural network produces significantly higher
inference accuracies than conventional neural network when the synapse devices
have nonlinear I-V characteristics.
"
"  In this work, we establish a full single-letter characterization of the
rate-distortion region of an instance of the Gray-Wyner model with side
information at the decoders. Specifically, in this model an encoder observes a
pair of memoryless, arbitrarily correlated, sources $(S^n_1,S^n_2)$ and
communicates with two receivers over an error-free rate-limited link of
capacity $R_0$, as well as error-free rate-limited individual links of
capacities $R_1$ to the first receiver and $R_2$ to the second receiver. Both
receivers reproduce the source component $S^n_2$ losslessly; and Receiver $1$
also reproduces the source component $S^n_1$ lossily, to within some prescribed
fidelity level $D_1$. Also, Receiver $1$ and Receiver $2$ are equipped
respectively with memoryless side information sequences $Y^n_1$ and $Y^n_2$.
Important in this setup, the side information sequences are arbitrarily
correlated among them, and with the source pair $(S^n_1,S^n_2)$; and are not
assumed to exhibit any particular ordering. Furthermore, by specializing the
main result to two Heegard-Berger models with successive refinement and
scalable coding, we shed light on the roles of the common and private
descriptions that the encoder should produce and what they should carry
optimally. We develop intuitions by analyzing the developed single-letter
optimal rate-distortion regions of these models, and discuss some insightful
binary examples.

"  There are many web-based visualization systems available to date, each having
its strengths and limitations. The goals these systems set out to accomplish
influence design decisions and determine how reusable and scalable they are.
Weave is a new web-based visualization platform with the broad goal of enabling
visualization of any available data by anyone for any purpose. Our open source
framework supports highly interactive linked visualizations for users of
varying skill levels. What sets Weave apart from other systems is its
consideration for real-time remote collaboration with session history. We
provide a detailed account of the various framework designs we considered with
comparisons to existing state-of-the-art systems.

"  Previous approaches to training syntax-based sentiment classification models
required phrase-level annotated corpora, which are not readily available in
many languages other than English. Thus, we propose the use of tree-structured
Long Short-Term Memory with an attention mechanism that pays attention to each
subtree of the parse tree. Experimental results indicate that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance in a Japanese sentiment
classification task.
"
"  Sparse superposition (SS) codes were originally proposed as a
capacity-achieving communication scheme over the additive white Gaussian noise
channel (AWGNC) [1]. Very recently, it was discovered that these codes are
universal, in the sense that they achieve capacity over any memoryless channel
under generalized approximate message-passing (GAMP) decoding [2], although
this decoder has never been stated for SS codes. In this contribution we
introduce the GAMP decoder for SS codes, we confirm empirically the
universality of this communication scheme through its study on various channels
and we provide the main analysis tools: state evolution and potential. We also
compare the performance of GAMP with the Bayes-optimal MMSE decoder. We
empirically illustrate that despite the presence of a phase transition
preventing GAMP to reach the optimal performance, spatial coupling allows to
boost the performance that eventually tends to capacity in a proper limit. We
also prove that, in contrast with the AWGNC case, SS codes for binary input
channels have a vanishing error floor in the limit of large codewords.
Moreover, the performance of Hadamard-based encoders is assessed for practical
implementations.

"  When developing general purpose robots, the overarching software architecture
can greatly affect the ease of accomplishing various tasks. Initial efforts to
create unified robot systems in the 1990s led to hybrid architectures,
emphasizing a hierarchy in which deliberative plans direct the use of reactive
skills. However, since that time there has been significant progress in the
low-level skills available to robots, including manipulation and perception,
making it newly feasible to accomplish many more tasks in real-world domains.
There is thus renewed optimism that robots will be able to perform a wide array
of tasks while maintaining responsiveness to human operators. However, the top
layer in traditional hybrid architectures, designed to achieve long-term goals,
can make it difficult to react quickly to human interactions during goal-driven
execution. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a novel architecture that
supports such transitions by adding a top-level reactive module which has
flexible access to both reactive skills and a deliberative control module. To
validate this architecture, we present a case study of its application on a
domestic service robot platform.
"
"  We propose an approach to estimate 3D human pose in real world units from a
single RGBD image and show that it exceeds performance of monocular 3D pose
estimation approaches from color as well as pose estimation exclusively from
depth. Our approach builds on robust human keypoint detectors for color images
and incorporates depth for lifting into 3D. We combine the system with our
learning from demonstration framework to instruct a service robot without the
need of markers. Experiments in real world settings demonstrate that our
approach enables a PR2 robot to imitate manipulation actions observed from a
human teacher.
"
"  Nonclassical states of a quantized light are described in terms of
Glauber-Sudarshan P distribution which is not a genuine classical probability
distribution. Despite several attempts, defining a uniform measure of
nonclassicality (NC) for the single mode quantum states of light is yet an open
task. In our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 95, 012330 (2017)] we have shown that
the existing well-known measures fail to quantify the NC of single mode states
that are generated under multiple NC-inducing operations. Recently, Ivan et.
al. [Quantum. Inf. Process. 11, 853 (2012)] have defined a measure of
non-Gaussian character of quantum optical states in terms of Wehrl entropy.
Here, we adopt this concept in the context of single mode NC. In this paper, we
propose a new quantification of NC for the single mode quantum states of light
as the difference between the total Wehrl entropy of the state and the maximum
Wehrl entropy arising due to its classical characteristics. This we achieve by
subtracting from its Wehrl entropy, the maximum Wehrl entropy attainable by any
classical state that has same randomness as measured in terms of von-Neumann
entropy. We obtain analytic expressions of NC for most of the states, in
particular, all pure states and Gaussian mixed states. However, the evaluation
of NC for the non-Gaussian mixed states is subject to extensive numerical
computation that lies beyond the scope of the current work. We show that, along
with the states generated under single NC-inducing operations, also for the
broader class of states that are generated under multiple NC-inducing
operations, our quantification enumerates the NC consistently.

"  Following the recent progress in image classification and captioning using
deep learning, we develop a novel natural language person retrieval system
based on an attention mechanism. More specifically, given the description of a
person, the goal is to localize the person in an image. To this end, we first
construct a benchmark dataset for natural language person retrieval. To do so,
we generate bounding boxes for persons in a public image dataset from the
segmentation masks, which are then annotated with descriptions and attributes
using the Amazon Mechanical Turk. We then adopt a region proposal network in
Faster R-CNN as a candidate region generator. The cropped images based on the
region proposals as well as the whole images with attention weights are fed
into Convolutional Neural Networks for visual feature extraction, while the
natural language expression and attributes are input to Bidirectional Long
Short- Term Memory (BLSTM) models for text feature extraction. The visual and
text features are integrated to score region proposals, and the one with the
highest score is retrieved as the output of our system. The experimental
results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method for
generic object retrieval and this line of research promises to benefit search
in surveillance video footage.

"  Machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, SVM and neural network
have played an increasingly important role in the process of scientific
discovery. However, none of them is both interpretable and accurate on
nonlinear datasets. Here we present contextual regression, a method that joins
these two desirable properties together using a hybrid architecture of neural
network embedding and dot product layer. We demonstrate its high prediction
accuracy and sensitivity through the task of predictive feature selection on a
simulated dataset and the application of predicting open chromatin sites in the
human genome. On the simulated data, our method achieved high fidelity recovery
of feature contributions under random noise levels up to 200%. On the open
chromatin dataset, the application of our method not only outperformed the
state of the art method in terms of accuracy, but also unveiled two previously
unfound open chromatin related histone marks. Our method can fill the blank of
accurate and interpretable nonlinear modeling in scientific data mining tasks.

"  Constraint Handling Rules is an effective concurrent declarative programming
language and a versatile computational logic formalism. CHR programs consist of
guarded reactive rules that transform multisets of constraints. One of the main
features of CHR is its inherent concurrency. Intuitively, rules can be applied
to parts of a multiset in parallel. In this comprehensive survey, we give an
overview of concurrent and parallel as well as distributed CHR semantics,
standard and more exotic, that have been proposed over the years at various
levels of refinement. These semantics range from the abstract to the concrete.
They are related by formal soundness results. Their correctness is established
as correspondence between parallel and sequential computations. We present
common concise sample CHR programs that have been widely used in experiments
and benchmarks. We review parallel CHR implementations in software and
hardware. The experimental results obtained show a consistent parallel speedup.
Most implementations are available online. The CHR formalism can also be used
to implement and reason with models for concurrency. To this end, the Software
Transaction Model, the Actor Model, Colored Petri Nets and the Join-Calculus
have been faithfully encoded in CHR. Under consideration in Theory and Practice

"  Many people are suffering from voice disorders, which can adversely affect
the quality of their lives. In response, some researchers have proposed
algorithms for automatic assessment of these disorders, based on voice signals.
However, these signals can be sensitive to the recording devices. Indeed, the
channel effect is a pervasive problem in machine learning for healthcare. In
this study, we propose a detection system for pathological voice, which is
robust against the channel effect. This system is based on a bidirectional LSTM
network. To increase the performance robustness against channel mismatch, we
integrate domain adversarial training (DAT) to eliminate the differences
between the devices. When we train on data recorded on a high-quality
microphone and evaluate on smartphone data without labels, our robust detection
system increases the PR-AUC from 0.8448 to 0.9455 (and 0.9522 with target
sample labels). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying
unsupervised domain adaptation to pathological voice detection. Notably, our
system does not need target device sample labels, which allows for
generalization to many new devices.

"  Computing a basis for the exponent lattice of algebraic numbers is a basic
problem in the field of computational number theory with applications to many
other areas. The main cost of a well-known algorithm
\cite{ge1993algorithms,kauers2005algorithms} solving the problem is on
computing the primitive element of the extended field generated by the given
algebraic numbers. When the extended field is of large degree, the problem
seems intractable by the tool implementing the algorithm. In this paper, a
special kind of exponent lattice basis is introduced. An important feature of
the basis is that it can be inductively constructed, which allows us to deal
with the given algebraic numbers one by one when computing the basis. Based on
this, an effective framework for constructing exponent lattice basis is
proposed. Through computing a so-called pre-basis first and then solving some
linear Diophantine equations, the basis can be efficiently constructed. A new
certificate for multiplicative independence and some techniques for decreasing
degrees of algebraic numbers are provided to speed up the computation. The new
algorithm has been implemented with Mathematica and its effectiveness is
verified by testing various examples. Moreover, the algorithm is applied to
program verification for finding invariants of linear loops.

"  Today's landscape of robotics is dominated by vertical integration where
single vendors develop the final product leading to slow progress, expensive
products and customer lock-in. Opposite to this, an horizontal integration
would result in a rapid development of cost-effective mass-market products with
an additional consumer empowerment. The transition of an industry from vertical
integration to horizontal integration is typically catalysed by de facto
industry standards that enable a simplified and seamless integration of
products. However, in robotics there is currently no leading candidate for a
global plug-and-play standard.
This paper tackles the problem of incompatibility between robot components
that hinder the reconfigurability and flexibility demanded by the robotics
industry. Particularly, it presents a model to create plug-and-play robot
hardware components. Rather than iteratively evolving previous ontologies, our
proposed model answers the needs identified by the industry while facilitating
interoperability, measurability and comparability of robotics technology. Our
approach differs significantly with the ones presented before as it is
hardware-oriented and establishes a clear set of actions towards the
integration of this model in real environments and with real manufacturers.

"  Machine learning models, especially based on deep architectures are used in
everyday applications ranging from self driving cars to medical diagnostics. It
has been shown that such models are dangerously susceptible to adversarial
samples, indistinguishable from real samples to human eye, adversarial samples
lead to incorrect classifications with high confidence. Impact of adversarial
samples is far-reaching and their efficient detection remains an open problem.
We propose to use direct density ratio estimation as an efficient model
agnostic measure to detect adversarial samples. Our proposed method works
equally well with single and multi-channel samples, and with different
adversarial sample generation methods. We also propose a method to use density
ratio estimates for generating adversarial samples with an added constraint of
preserving density ratio.

"  We study the query complexity of cake cutting and give lower and upper bounds
for computing approximately envy-free, perfect, and equitable allocations with
the minimum number of cuts. The lower bounds are tight for computing connected
envy-free allocations among n=3 players and for computing perfect and equitable
allocations with minimum number of cuts between n=2 players.
We also formalize moving knife procedures and show that a large subclass of
this family, which captures all the known moving knife procedures, can be
simulated efficiently with arbitrarily small error in the Robertson-Webb query
model.

"  This paper studies the emotion recognition from musical tracks in the
2-dimensional valence-arousal (V-A) emotional space. We propose a method based
on convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), having

the same task. We utilize one CNN layer followed by two branches of RNNs
trained separately for arousal and valence. The method was evaluated using the
'MediaEval2015 emotion in music' dataset. We achieved an RMSE of 0.202 for
arousal and 0.268 for valence, which is the best result reported on this

"  Reinforcement learning methods require careful design involving a reward
function to obtain the desired action policy for a given task. In the absence
of hand-crafted reward functions, prior work on the topic has proposed several
methods for reward estimation by using expert state trajectories and action
pairs. However, there are cases where complete or good action information
cannot be obtained from expert demonstrations. We propose a novel reinforcement
learning method in which the agent learns an internal model of observation on
the basis of expert-demonstrated state trajectories to estimate rewards without
completely learning the dynamics of the external environment from state-action
pairs. The internal model is obtained in the form of a predictive model for the
given expert state distribution. During reinforcement learning, the agent
predicts the reward as a function of the difference between the actual state
and the state predicted by the internal model. We conducted multiple
experiments in environments of varying complexity, including the Super Mario
Bros and Flappy Bird games. We show our method successfully trains good
policies directly from expert game-play videos.

"  In evolutionary biology, the speciation history of living organisms is
represented graphically by a phylogeny, that is, a rooted tree whose leaves
correspond to current species and branchings indicate past speciation events.
Phylogenies are commonly estimated from molecular sequences, such as DNA
sequences, collected from the species of interest. At a high level, the idea
behind this inference is simple: the further apart in the Tree of Life are two
species, the greater is the number of mutations to have accumulated in their
genomes since their most recent common ancestor. In order to obtain accurate
estimates in phylogenetic analyses, it is standard practice to employ
statistical approaches based on stochastic models of sequence evolution on a
tree. For tractability, such models necessarily make simplifying assumptions
about the evolutionary mechanisms involved. In particular, commonly omitted are
insertions and deletions of nucleotides -- also known as indels.
Properly accounting for indels in statistical phylogenetic analyses remains a
major challenge in computational evolutionary biology. Here we consider the
problem of reconstructing ancestral sequences on a known phylogeny in a model
of sequence evolution incorporating nucleotide substitutions, insertions and
deletions, specifically the classical TKF91 process. We focus on the case of
dense phylogenies of bounded height, which we refer to as the taxon-rich
setting, where statistical consistency is achievable. We give the first
polynomial-time ancestral reconstruction algorithm with provable guarantees
under constant rates of mutation. Our algorithm succeeds when the phylogeny
satisfies the ""big bang"" condition, a necessary and sufficient condition for
statistical consistency in this context.

of flow characteristics are formulated. Local and global flow characteristics
of networks bring closer the theory of complex networks to the systems theory

"  Mobile edge clouds (MECs) bring the benefits of the cloud closer to the user,
by installing small cloud infrastructures at the network edge. This enables a
new breed of real-time applications, such as instantaneous object recognition
and safety assistance in intelligent transportation systems, that require very
low latency. One key issue that comes with proximity is how to ensure that
users always receive good performance as they move across different locations.
Migrating services between MECs is seen as the means to achieve this. This
article presents a layered framework for migrating active service applications
that are encapsulated either in virtual machines (VMs) or containers. This
layering approach allows a substantial reduction in service downtime. The
framework is easy to implement using readily available technologies, and one of
its key advantages is that it supports containers, which is a promising
emerging technology that offers tangible benefits over VMs. The migration
performance of various real applications is evaluated by experiments under the
presented framework. Insights drawn from the experimentation results are
discussed.

"  End-to-end approaches have drawn much attention recently for significantly
simplifying the construction of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.
RNN transducer (RNN-T) is one of the popular end-to-end methods. Previous
studies have shown that RNN-T is difficult to train and a very complex training
process is needed for a reasonable performance. In this paper, we explore RNN-T
for a Chinese large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task and
aim to simplify the training process while maintaining performance. First, a
new strategy of learning rate decay is proposed to accelerate the model
convergence. Second, we find that adding convolutional layers at the beginning
of the network and using ordered data can discard the pre-training process of
the encoder without loss of performance. Besides, we design experiments to find
a balance among the usage of GPU memory, training circle and model performance.
Finally, we achieve 16.9% character error rate (CER) on our test set which is
2% absolute improvement from a strong BLSTM CE system with language model
trained on the same text corpus.

"  Elasticity is a cloud property that enables applications and its execution
systems to dynamically acquire and release shared computational resources on
demand. Moreover, it unfolds the advantage of economies of scale in the cloud
through a drop in the average costs of these shared resources. However, it is
still an open challenge to achieve a perfect match between resource demand and
provision in autonomous elasticity management. Resource adaptation decisions
essentially involve a trade-off between economics and performance, which
produces a gap between the ideal and actual resource provisioning. This gap, if
not properly managed, can negatively impact the aggregate utility of a cloud
customer in the long run. To address this limitation, we propose a technical
debt-aware learning approach for autonomous elasticity management based on a
reinforcement learning of elasticity debts in resource provisioning; the
adaptation pursues strategic decisions that trades off economics against
performance. We extend CloudSim and Burlap to evaluate our approach. The
evaluation shows that a reinforcement learning of technical debts in elasticity
obtains a higher utility for a cloud customer, while conforming expected levels
of performance.

"  Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established declarative paradigm. One
of the successes of ASP is the availability of efficient systems.
State-of-the-art systems are based on the ground+solve approach. In some
applications this approach is infeasible because the grounding of one or few
constraints is expensive. In this paper, we systematically compare alternative
strategies to avoid the instantiation of problematic constraints, that are
based on custom extensions of the solver. Results on real and synthetic

"  A variety of representation learning approaches have been investigated for
reinforcement learning; much less attention, however, has been given to
investigating the utility of sparse coding. Outside of reinforcement learning,
sparse coding representations have been widely used, with non-convex objectives
that result in discriminative representations. In this work, we develop a
supervised sparse coding objective for policy evaluation. Despite the
non-convexity of this objective, we prove that all local minima are global
minima, making the approach amenable to simple optimization strategies. We
empirically show that it is key to use a supervised objective, rather than the
more straightforward unsupervised sparse coding approach. We compare the
learned representations to a canonical fixed sparse representation, called
tile-coding, demonstrating that the sparse coding representation outperforms a
wide variety of tilecoding representations.

"  Humans can learn in a continuous manner. Old rarely utilized knowledge can be
overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used
knowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems,
lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over
tasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that,
given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be
learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by
neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined
Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a
neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which
is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter
of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a
change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important
parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge
related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an
interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb's
rule,which is a model for the learning process in the brain. We test our method
on a sequence of object recognition tasks and on the challenging problem of
learning an embedding for predicting $<$subject, predicate, object$>$ triplets.
We show state-of-the-art performance and, for the first time, the ability to
adapt the importance of the parameters based on unlabeled data towards what the
network needs (not) to forget, which may vary depending on test conditions.

"  Over the last decade, wireless networks have experienced an impressive growth
and now play a main role in many telecommunications systems. As a consequence,
scarce radio resources, such as frequencies, became congested and the need for
effective and efficient assignment methods arose. In this work, we present a
Genetic Algorithm for solving large instances of the Power, Frequency and
Modulation Assignment Problem, arising in the design of wireless networks. To
our best knowledge, this is the first Genetic Algorithm that is proposed for
such problem. Compared to previous works, our approach allows a wider
exploration of the set of power solutions, while eliminating sources of
numerical problems. The performance of the algorithm is assessed by tests over
a set of large realistic instances of a Fixed WiMAX Network.

"  Atar, Chowdhary and Dupuis have recently exhibited a variational formula for
exponential integrals of bounded measurable functions in terms of Rényi
divergences. We develop a variational characterization of the Rényi
divergences between two probability distributions on a measurable sace in terms
of relative entropies. When combined with the elementary variational formula
for exponential integrals of bounded measurable functions in terms of relative
entropy, this yields the variational formula of Atar, Chowdhary and Dupuis as a
corollary. We also develop an analogous variational characterization of the
Rényi divergence rates between two stationary finite state Markov chains in
terms of relative entropy rates. When combined with Varadhan's variational
characterization of the spectral radius of square matrices with nonnegative
entries in terms of relative entropy, this yields an analog of the variational
formula of Atar, Chowdary and Dupuis in the framework of finite state Markov
chains.

"  People with profound motor deficits could perform useful physical tasks for
themselves by controlling robots that are comparable to the human body. Whether
this is possible without invasive interfaces has been unclear, due to the
robot's complexity and the person's limitations. We developed a novel,
augmented reality interface and conducted two studies to evaluate the extent to
which it enabled people with profound motor deficits to control robotic body
surrogates. 15 novice users achieved meaningful improvements on a clinical
manipulation assessment when controlling the robot in Atlanta from locations
across the United States. Also, one expert user performed 59 distinct tasks in
his own home over seven days, including self-care tasks such as feeding. Our
results demonstrate that people with profound motor deficits can effectively
control robotic body surrogates without invasive interfaces.

"  Object detection in wide area motion imagery (WAMI) has drawn the attention
of the computer vision research community for a number of years. WAMI proposes
a number of unique challenges including extremely small object sizes, both
sparse and densely-packed objects, and extremely large search spaces (large
video frames). Nearly all state-of-the-art methods in WAMI object detection
report that appearance-based classifiers fail in this challenging data and
instead rely almost entirely on motion information in the form of background
subtraction or frame-differencing. In this work, we experimentally verify the
failure of appearance-based classifiers in WAMI, such as Faster R-CNN and a
heatmap-based fully convolutional neural network (CNN), and propose a novel
two-stage spatio-temporal CNN which effectively and efficiently combines both
appearance and motion information to significantly surpass the state-of-the-art
in WAMI object detection. To reduce the large search space, the first stage
(ClusterNet) takes in a set of extremely large video frames, combines the
motion and appearance information within the convolutional architecture, and
proposes regions of objects of interest (ROOBI). These ROOBI can contain from
one to clusters of several hundred objects due to the large video frame size
and varying object density in WAMI. The second stage (FoveaNet) then estimates
the centroid location of all objects in that given ROOBI simultaneously via
heatmap estimation. The proposed method exceeds state-of-the-art results on the
WPAFB 2009 dataset by 5-16% for moving objects and nearly 50% for stopped
objects, as well as being the first proposed method in wide area motion imagery
to detect completely stationary objects.
"
"  Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), most famously used in game-play artificial
intelligence (e.g., the game of Go), is a well-known strategy for constructing
approximate solutions to sequential decision problems. Its primary innovation
is the use of a heuristic, known as a default policy, to obtain Monte Carlo
estimates of downstream values for states in a decision tree. This information
is used to iteratively expand the tree towards regions of states and actions
that an optimal policy might visit. However, to guarantee convergence to the
optimal action, MCTS requires the entire tree to be expanded asymptotically. In
this paper, we propose a new technique called Primal-Dual MCTS that utilizes
sampled information relaxation upper bounds on potential actions, creating the
possibility of ""ignoring"" parts of the tree that stem from highly suboptimal
choices. This allows us to prove that despite converging to a partial decision
tree in the limit, the recommended action from Primal-Dual MCTS is optimal. The
new approach shows significant promise when used to optimize the behavior of a
single driver navigating a graph while operating on a ride-sharing platform.
Numerical experiments on a real dataset of 7,000 trips in New Jersey suggest
that Primal-Dual MCTS improves upon standard MCTS by producing deeper decision
trees and exhibits a reduced sensitivity to the size of the action space.
"
"  Retrosynthesis is a technique to plan the chemical synthesis of organic
molecules, for example drugs, agro- and fine chemicals. In retrosynthesis, a
search tree is built by analysing molecules recursively and dissecting them
into simpler molecular building blocks until one obtains a set of known
building blocks. The search space is intractably large, and it is difficult to
determine the value of retrosynthetic positions. Here, we propose to model
retrosynthesis as a Markov Decision Process. In combination with a Deep Neural
Network policy learned from essentially the complete published knowledge of
chemistry, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can be used to evaluate positions. In
exploratory studies, we demonstrate that MCTS with neural network policies
outperforms the traditionally used best-first search with hand-coded
heuristics.

"  In this work we examine how the updates addressing Meltdown and Spectre
vulnerabilities impact the performance of HPC applications. To study this we
use the application kernel module of XDMoD to test the performance before and
after the application of the vulnerability patches. We tested the performance
difference for multiple application and benchmarks including: NWChem, NAMD,
HPCC, IOR, MDTest and IMB. The results show that although some specific
functions can have performance decreased by as much as 74%, the majority of
individual metrics indicates little to no decrease in performance. The
real-world applications show a 2-3% decrease in performance for single node
jobs and a 5-11% decrease for parallel multi node jobs.

"  Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness all over the world, with
approximately 60 million cases reported worldwide in 2010. If undiagnosed in
time, glaucoma causes irreversible damage to the optic nerve leading to
blindness. The optic nerve head examination, which involves measurement of
cup-to-disc ratio, is considered one of the most valuable methods of structural
diagnosis of the disease. Estimation of cup-to-disc ratio requires segmentation
of optic disc and optic cup on eye fundus images and can be performed by modern
computer vision algorithms. This work presents universal approach for automatic
optic disc and cup segmentation, which is based on deep learning, namely,
modification of U-Net convolutional neural network. Our experiments include
comparison with the best known methods on publicly available databases
DRIONS-DB, RIM-ONE v.3, DRISHTI-GS. For both optic disc and cup segmentation,
our method achieves quality comparable to current state-of-the-art methods,
outperforming them in terms of the prediction time.

"  The life of the modern world essentially depends on the work of the large
artificial homogeneous networks, such as wired and wireless communication
systems, networks of roads and pipelines. The support of their effective
continuous functioning requires automatic screening and permanent optimization
with processing of the huge amount of data by high-performance distributed
systems. We propose new meta-algorithm of large homogeneous network analysis,
its decomposition into alternative sets of loosely connected subnets, and
parallel optimization of the most independent elements. This algorithm is based
on a network-specific correlation function, Simulated Annealing technique, and
is adapted to work in the computer cluster. On the example of large wireless
network, we show that proposed algorithm essentially increases speed of
parallel optimization. The elaborated general approach can be used for analysis
and optimization of the wide range of networks, including such specific types
as artificial neural networks or organized in networks physiological systems of
living organisms.
"
"  This paper considers the actor-critic contextual bandit for the mobile health
(mHealth) intervention. The state-of-the-art decision-making methods in mHealth
generally assume that the noise in the dynamic system follows the Gaussian
distribution. Those methods use the least-square-based algorithm to estimate
the expected reward, which is prone to the existence of outliers. To deal with
the issue of outliers, we propose a novel robust actor-critic contextual bandit
method for the mHealth intervention. In the critic updating, the
capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm is used to measure the approximation error, which
prevents outliers from dominating our objective. A set of weights could be
achieved from the critic updating. Considering them gives a weighted objective
for the actor updating. It provides the badly noised sample in the critic
updating with zero weights for the actor updating. As a result, the robustness
of both actor-critic updating is enhanced. There is a key parameter in the
capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm. We provide a reliable method to properly set it by
making use of one of the most fundamental definitions of outliers in
statistics. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method can
achieve almost identical results compared with the state-of-the-art methods on
the dataset without outliers and dramatically outperform them on the datasets
noised by outliers.

"  This work presents a new method to quantify connectivity in transportation

novel approach to explore the robustness of road network connectivity in the
presence of congestion on the roadway. The robustness of the pattern is

traffic datasets commonly used for navigation. As an initial demonstration, we
illustrate the main technique on a publicly available traffic dataset in a

"  Stacking-based deep neural network (S-DNN), in general, denotes a deep neural
network (DNN) resemblance in terms of its very deep, feedforward network
architecture. The typical S-DNN aggregates a variable number of individually
learnable modules in series to assemble a DNN-alike alternative to the targeted
object recognition tasks. This work likewise devises an S-DNN instantiation,
dubbed deep analytic network (DAN), on top of the spectral histogram (SH)
features. The DAN learning principle relies on ridge regression, and some key
DNN constituents, specifically, rectified linear unit, fine-tuning, and
normalization. The DAN aptitude is scrutinized on three repositories of varying
domains, including FERET (faces), MNIST (handwritten digits), and CIFAR10
(natural objects). The empirical results unveil that DAN escalates the SH
baseline performance over a sufficiently deep layer.

"  In this paper, we propose a practical receiver for multicarrier signals
subjected to a strong memoryless nonlinearity. The receiver design is based on
a generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) framework, and this allows
real-time algorithm implementation in software or hardware with moderate
complexity. We demonstrate that the proposed receiver can provide more than a
2dB gain compared with an ideal uncoded linear OFDM transmission at a BER range
$10^{-4}\div10^{-6}$ in the AWGN channel, when the OFDM signal is subjected to
clipping nonlinearity and the crest-factor of the clipped waveform is only
1.9dB. Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed receiver provides
significant performance gain in frequency-selective multipath channels
"
"  Dynamic languages often employ reflection primitives to turn dynamically
generated text into executable code at run-time. These features make standard
static analysis extremely hard if not impossible because its essential data
structures, i.e., the control-flow graph and the system of recursive equations
associated with the program to analyse, are themselves dynamically mutating
objects. We introduce SEA, an abstract interpreter for automatic sound string
executability analysis of dynamic languages employing bounded (i.e, finitely
nested) reflection and dynamic code generation. Strings are statically
approximated in an abstract domain of finite state automata with basic
operations implemented as symbolic transducers. SEA combines standard program
analysis together with string executability analysis. The analysis of a call to
reflection determines a call to the same abstract interpreter over a code which
is synthesised directly from the result of the static string executability
analysis at that program point. The use of regular languages for approximating
dynamically generated code structures allows SEA to soundly approximate safety
properties of self modifying programs yet maintaining efficiency. Soundness
here means that the semantics of the code synthesised by the analyser to
resolve reflection over-approximates the semantics of the code dynamically
built at run-rime by the program at that point.

"  Reductions for transition systems have been recently introduced as a uniform
and principled method for comparing the expressiveness of system models with
respect to a range of properties, especially bisimulations. In this paper we
study the expressiveness (w.r.t. bisimulations) of models for quantitative
computations such as weighted labelled transition systems (WLTSs), uniform
labelled transition systems (ULTraSs), and state-to-function transition systems
(FuTSs). We prove that there is a trade-off between labels and weights: at one
extreme lays the class of (unlabelled) weighted transition systems where
information is presented using weights only; at the other lays the class of
labelled transition systems (LTSs) where information is shifted on labels.
These categories of systems cannot be further reduced in any significant way
and subsume all the aforementioned models.

"  Electronic Health Records (EHR) are data generated during routine clinical
care. EHR offer researchers unprecedented phenotypic breadth and depth and have
the potential to accelerate the pace of precision medicine at scale. A main EHR
use-case is creating phenotyping algorithms to define disease status, onset and
severity. Currently, no common machine-readable standard exists for defining
phenotyping algorithms which often are stored in human-readable formats. As a
result, the translation of algorithms to implementation code is challenging and
sharing across the scientific community is problematic. In this paper, we
evaluate openEHR, a formal EHR data specification, for computable
representations of EHR phenotyping algorithms.

"  Mission critical data dissemination in massive Internet of things (IoT)
networks imposes constraints on the message transfer delay between devices. Due
to low power and communication range of IoT devices, data is foreseen to be
relayed over multiple device-to-device (D2D) links before reaching the
destination. The coexistence of a massive number of IoT devices poses a
challenge in maximizing the successful transmission capacity of the overall
network alongside reducing the multi-hop transmission delay in order to support
mission critical applications. There is a delicate interplay between the
carrier sensing threshold of the contention based medium access protocol and
the choice of packet forwarding strategy selected at each hop by the devices.
The fundamental problem in optimizing the performance of such networks is to
balance the tradeoff between conflicting performance objectives such as the
spatial frequency reuse, transmission quality, and packet progress towards the
destination. In this paper, we use a stochastic geometry approach to quantify
the performance of multi-hop massive IoT networks in terms of the spatial
frequency reuse and the transmission quality under different packet forwarding
schemes. We also develop a comprehensive performance metric that can be used to
optimize the system to achieve the best performance. The results can be used to
select the best forwarding scheme and tune the carrier sensing threshold to
optimize the performance of the network according to the delay constraints and
transmission quality requirements.

"  The principle of democracy is that the people govern through elected
representatives. Therefore, a democracy is healthy as long as the elected
politicians do represent the people. We have analyzed data from the Brazilian
electoral court (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, TSE) concerning money donations
for the electoral campaigns and the election results. Our work points to two
disturbing conclusions: money is a determining factor on whether a candidate is
elected or not (as opposed to representativeness); secondly, the use of
Benford's Law to analyze the declared donations received by the parties and
electoral campaigns shows evidence of fraud in the declarations. A better term
to define Brazil's government system is what we define as chrimatocracy (govern
by money).

"  With the increasing commoditization of computer vision, speech recognition
and machine translation systems and the widespread deployment of learning-based
back-end technologies such as digital advertising and intelligent
infrastructures, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has moved from research labs to
production. These changes have been made possible by unprecedented levels of
data and computation, by methodological advances in machine learning, by
innovations in systems software and architectures, and by the broad
accessibility of these technologies.
The next generation of AI systems promises to accelerate these developments
and increasingly impact our lives via frequent interactions and making (often
mission-critical) decisions on our behalf, often in highly personalized
contexts. Realizing this promise, however, raises daunting challenges. In
particular, we need AI systems that make timely and safe decisions in
unpredictable environments, that are robust against sophisticated adversaries,
and that can process ever increasing amounts of data across organizations and
individuals without compromising confidentiality. These challenges will be
exacerbated by the end of the Moore's Law, which will constrain the amount of
data these technologies can store and process. In this paper, we propose
several open research directions in systems, architectures, and security that
can address these challenges and help unlock AI's potential to improve lives
and society.

"  Runtime enforcement can be effectively used to improve the reliability of
software applications. However, it often requires the definition of ad hoc
policies and enforcement strategies, which might be expensive to identify and
implement. This paper discusses how to exploit lifecycle events to obtain
useful enforcement strategies that can be easily reused across applications,
thus reducing the cost of adoption of the runtime enforcement technology. The
paper finally sketches how this idea can be used to define libraries that can
automatically overcome problems related to applications misusing them.
"
"  The atomic norm provides a generalization of the $\ell_1$-norm to continuous
parameter spaces. When applied as a sparse regularizer for line spectral
estimation the solution can be obtained by solving a convex optimization
problem. This problem is known as atomic norm soft thresholding (AST). It can
be cast as a semidefinite program and solved by standard methods. In the
semidefinite formulation there are $O(N^2)$ dual variables and a standard
primal-dual interior point method requires at least $O(N^6)$ flops per
iteration. That has lead researcher to consider alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) for the solution of AST, but this method is still somewhat
slow for large problem sizes. To obtain a faster algorithm we reformulate AST
as a non-symmetric conic program. That has two properties of key importance to
its numerical solution: the conic formulation has only $O(N)$ dual variables
and the Toeplitz structure inherent to AST is preserved. Based on it we derive
FastAST which is a primal-dual interior point method for solving AST. Two
variants are considered with the fastest one requiring only $O(N^2)$ flops per
iteration. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that FastAST solves AST
significantly faster than a state-of-the-art solver based on ADMM.

"  We study the problem of causal structure learning over a set of random
variables when the experimenter is allowed to perform at most $M$ experiments
in a non-adaptive manner. We consider the optimal learning strategy in terms of
minimizing the portions of the structure that remains unknown given the limited
number of experiments in both Bayesian and minimax setting. We characterize the
theoretical optimal solution and propose an algorithm, which designs the
experiments efficiently in terms of time complexity. We show that for bounded
degree graphs, in the minimax case and in the Bayesian case with uniform
priors, our proposed algorithm is a $\rho$-approximation algorithm, where
$\rho$ is independent of the order of the underlying graph. Simulations on both
synthetic and real data show that the performance of our algorithm is very
close to the optimal solution.
"
"  We present a novel data-driven nested optimization framework that addresses
the problem of coupling between plant and controller optimization. This
optimization strategy is tailored towards instances where a closed-form
expression for the system dynamic response is unobtainable and simulations or
experiments are necessary. Specifically, Bayesian Optimization, which is a
data-driven technique for finding the optimum of an unknown and
expensive-to-evaluate objective function, is employed to solve a nested
optimization problem. The underlying objective function is modeled by a
Gaussian Process (GP); then, Bayesian Optimization utilizes the predictive
uncertainty information from the GP to determine the best subsequent control or
plant parameters. The proposed framework differs from the majority of co-design
literature where there exists a closed-form model of the system dynamics.
Furthermore, we utilize the idea of Batch Bayesian Optimization at the plant
optimization level to generate a set of plant designs at each iteration of the
overall optimization process, recognizing that there will exist economies of
scale in running multiple experiments in each iteration of the plant design
process. We validate the proposed framework for a Buoyant Airborne Turbine
(BAT). We choose the horizontal stabilizer area, longitudinal center of mass
relative to center of buoyancy (plant parameters), and the pitch angle
set-point (controller parameter) as our decision variables. Our results
demonstrate that these plant and control parameters converge to their
respective optimal values within only a few iterations.
"
"  Most of the codes that have an algebraic decoding algorithm are derived from
the Reed Solomon codes. They are obtained by taking equivalent codes, for
example the generalized Reed Solomon codes, or by using the so-called subfield
subcode method, which leads to Alternant codes and Goppa codes over the
underlying prime field, or over some intermediate subfield. The main advantages
of these constructions is to preserve both the minimum distance and the
decoding algorithm of the underlying Reed Solomon code. In this paper, we
propose a generalization of the subfield subcode construction by introducing
the notion of subspace subcodes and a generalization of the equivalence of
codes which leads to the notion of generalized subspace subcodes. When the
dimension of the selected subspaces is equal to one, we show that our approach
gives exactly the family of the codes obtained by equivalence and subfield
subcode technique. However, our approach highlights the links between the
subfield subcode of a code defined over an extension field and the operation of
puncturing the $q$-ary image of this code. When the dimension of the subspaces
is greater than one, we obtain codes whose alphabet is no longer a finite
field, but a set of r-uples. We explain why these codes are practically as
efficient for applications as the codes defined on an extension of degree r. In
addition, they make it possible to obtain decodable codes over a large alphabet
having parameters previously inaccessible. As an application, we give some
examples that can be used in public key cryptosystems such as McEliece.

"  The handwritten string recognition is still a challengeable task, though the
powerful deep learning tools were introduced. In this paper, based on TAO-FCN,
we proposed an end-to-end system for handwritten string recognition. Compared
with the conventional methods, there is no preprocess nor manually designed
rules employed. With enough labelled data, it is easy to apply the proposed
method to different applications. Although the performance of the proposed
method may not be comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches, it's
usability and robustness are more meaningful for practical applications.

"  These lectures notes were written for a summer school on Mathematics for
post-quantum cryptography in Thiès, Senegal. They try to provide a guide for
Masters' students to get through the vast literature on elliptic curves,
without getting lost on their way to learning isogeny based cryptography. They
are by no means a reference text on the theory of elliptic curves, nor on
cryptography; students are encouraged to complement these notes with some of
the books recommended in the bibliography.
The presentation is divided in three parts, roughly corresponding to the
three lectures given. In an effort to keep the reader interested, each part
alternates between the fundamental theory of elliptic curves, and applications
in cryptography. We often prefer to have the main ideas flow smoothly, rather
than having a rigorous presentation as one would have in a more classical book.
The reader will excuse us for the inaccuracies and the omissions.

"  In this paper, we provide an analysis of self-organized network management,
with an end-to-end perspective of the network. Self-organization as applied to
cellular networks is usually referred to Self-organizing Networks (SONs), and
it is a key driver for improving Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
(OAM) activities. SON aims at reducing the cost of installation and management
of 4G and future 5G networks, by simplifying operational tasks through the
capability to configure, optimize and heal itself. To satisfy 5G network
management requirements, this autonomous management vision has to be extended
to the end to end network. In literature and also in some instances of products
available in the market, Machine Learning (ML) has been identified as the key
tool to implement autonomous adaptability and take advantage of experience when
making decisions. In this paper, we survey how network management can
significantly benefit from ML solutions. We review and provide the basic
concepts and taxonomy for SON, network management and ML. We analyse the
available state of the art in the literature, standardization, and in the
market. We pay special attention to 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
evolution in the area of network management and to the data that can be
extracted from 3GPP networks, in order to gain knowledge and experience in how
the network is working, and improve network performance in a proactive way.
Finally, we go through the main challenges associated with this line of
research, in both 4G and in what 5G is getting designed, while identifying new
directions for research.

"  Understanding smart grid cyber attacks is key for developing appropriate
protection and recovery measures. Advanced attacks pursue maximized impact at
minimized costs and detectability. This paper conducts risk analysis of
combined data integrity and availability attacks against the power system state
estimation. We compare the combined attacks with pure integrity attacks - false
data injection (FDI) attacks. A security index for vulnerability assessment to
these two kinds of attacks is proposed and formulated as a mixed integer linear
programming problem. We show that such combined attacks can succeed with fewer
resources than FDI attacks. The combined attacks with limited knowledge of the
system model also expose advantages in keeping stealth against the bad data
detection. Finally, the risk of combined attacks to reliable system operation
is evaluated using the results from vulnerability assessment and attack impact
analysis. The findings in this paper are validated and supported by a detailed
case study.

"  We propose a family of near-metrics based on local graph diffusion to capture
similarity for a wide class of data sets. These quasi-metametrics, as their
names suggest, dispense with one or two standard axioms of metric spaces,
specifically distinguishability and symmetry, so that similarity between data
points of arbitrary type and form could be measured broadly and effectively.
The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its
reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features.
By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for
categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and
text extracted via deep learning approaches. We conduct extensive experiments
to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare
and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific
application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for
structured data including categorical and continuous data, the near-metrics
corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of
the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and
images including those extracted from deep learning, the near-metrics derived
from normalized and reverse k-step graph diffusion (k very small) exhibit
outstanding ability to distinguish data points from different classes.

"  Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar
computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods
for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what'
and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among
many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design
needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable
recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one
can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show
that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a
problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN
architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and
feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and
short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture
on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based
system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms
current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual
cortex.

"  The extremely low efficiency is regarded as the bottleneck of Wireless Power
Transfer (WPT) technology. To tackle this problem, either enlarging the
transfer power or changing the infrastructure of WPT system could be an
intuitively proposed way. However, the drastically important issue on the user
exposure of electromagnetic radiation is rarely considered while we try to
improve the efficiency of WPT. In this paper, a Distributed Antenna Power
Beacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where these antennas are uniformly distributed
on a circle is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation
level (SERL) requirement. In this model, three key questions are intended to be
answered: 1) With the SERL, what is the performance of the harvested power at
the users ? 2) How do we configure the parameters to maximize the efficiency of
WPT? 3) Under the same constraints, does the DA-PB still have performance gain
than the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB)? First, the minimum antenna height of
DA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation
power density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL
published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the
closed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user
in the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order
to maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed
antennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the
typical value $2$ and $4$. For comparison, the CA-PB is also analyzed as a
benchmark. Simulation results verify our derived theoretical results. And it is
shown that the proposed DA-PB indeed achieves larger average harvested DC power
than CA-PB and can improve the efficiency of WPT.

"  A numerical method for particle-laden fluids interacting with a deformable
solid domain and mobile rigid parts is proposed and implemented in a full
engineering system. The fluid domain is modeled with a lattice Boltzmann
representation, the particles and rigid parts are modeled with a discrete
element representation, and the deformable solid domain is modeled using a
Lagrangian mesh. The main issue of this work, since separately each of these
methods is a mature tool, is to develop coupling and model-reduction approaches
in order to efficiently simulate coupled problems of this nature, as occur in
various geological and engineering applications. The lattice Boltzmann method
incorporates a large-eddy simulation technique using the Smagorinsky turbulence
model. The discrete element method incorporates spherical and polyhedral
particles for stiff contact interactions. A neo-Hookean hyperelastic model is
used for the deformable solid. We provide a detailed description of how to
couple the three solvers within a unified algorithm. The technique we propose
for rubber modeling/coupling exploits a simplification that prevents having to
solve a finite-element problem each time step. We also develop a technique to
reduce the domain size of the full system by replacing certain zones with
quasi-analytic solutions, which act as effective boundary conditions for the
lattice Boltzmann method. The major ingredients of the routine are are
separately validated. To demonstrate the coupled method in full, we simulate
slurry flows in two kinds of piston-valve geometries. The dynamics of the valve
and slurry are studied and reported over a large range of input parameters.

"  Social media has changed the ways of communication, where everyone is
equipped with the power to express their opinions to others in online
discussion platforms. Previously, a number of stud- ies have been presented to
identify opinion leaders in online discussion networks. Feng (""Are you
connected? Evaluating information cascade in online discussion about the
#RaceTogether campaign"", Computers in Human Behavior, 2016) identified five
types of central users and their communication patterns in an online
communication network of a limited time span. However, to trace the change in
communication pattern, a long-term analysis is required. In this study, we
critically analyzed framework presented by Feng based on five types of central
users in online communication network and their communication pattern in a
long-term manner. We take another case study presented by Udnor et al.
(""Determining social media impact on the politics of developing countries using
social network analytics"", Program, 2016) to further understand the dynamics as
well as to perform validation . Results indicate that there may not exist all
of these central users in an online communication network in a long-term
manner. Furthermore, we discuss the changing positions of opinion leaders and
their power to keep isolates interested in an online discussion network.

"  Due to the increasing dependency of critical infrastructure on synchronized
clocks, network time synchronization protocols have become an attractive target
for attackers. We identify data origin authentication as the key security
objective and suggest to employ recently proposed high-performance digital
signature schemes (Ed25519 and MQQ-SIG)) as foundation of a novel set of
security measures to secure multicast time synchronization. We conduct
experiments to verify the computational and communication efficiency for using
these signatures in the standard time synchronization protocols NTP and PTP. We
propose additional security measures to prevent replay attacks and to mitigate
delay attacks. Our proposed solutions cover 1-step mode for NTP and PTP and we
extend our security measures specifically to 2-step mode (PTP) and show that
they have no impact on time synchronization's precision.

"  It is often recommended that identifiers for ontology terms should be
semantics-free or meaningless. In practice, ontology developers tend to use
numeric identifiers, starting at 1 and working upwards. In this paper we
present a critique of current ontology semantics-free identifiers;
monotonically increasing numbers have a number of significant usability flaws
which make them unsuitable as a default option, and we present a series of
alternatives. We have provide an implementation of these alternatives which can
be freely combined.
"
"  Deep learning methods have achieved high performance in sound recognition
tasks. Deciding how to feed the training data is important for further
performance improvement. We propose a novel learning method for deep sound
recognition: Between-Class learning (BC learning). Our strategy is to learn a
discriminative feature space by recognizing the between-class sounds as
between-class sounds. We generate between-class sounds by mixing two sounds
belonging to different classes with a random ratio. We then input the mixed
sound to the model and train the model to output the mixing ratio. The
advantages of BC learning are not limited only to the increase in variation of
the training data; BC learning leads to an enlargement of Fisher's criterion in
the feature space and a regularization of the positional relationship among the
feature distributions of the classes. The experimental results show that BC
learning improves the performance on various sound recognition networks,
datasets, and data augmentation schemes, in which BC learning proves to be
always beneficial. Furthermore, we construct a new deep sound recognition
network (EnvNet-v2) and train it with BC learning. As a result, we achieved a
performance surpasses the human level.
"
"  Time-varying network topologies can deeply influence dynamical processes
mediated by them. Memory effects in the pattern of interactions among
individuals are also known to affect how diffusive and spreading phenomena take
place. In this paper we analyze the combined effect of these two ingredients on
epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible
(SIS) and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models on the recently
introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based
mean-field approach we derive, in the long time limit, analytical predictions
for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the
distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results
show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR
dynamics, therefore favouring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach
perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long time asymptotic regime.
Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic
threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss
in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose
understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated
temporal networks.

"  A long-standing obstacle to progress in deep learning is the problem of
vanishing and exploding gradients. Although, the problem has largely been
overcome via carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization,
architectures incorporating skip-connections such as highway and resnets
perform much better than standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen
initialization and batch normalization. In this paper, we identify the
shattered gradients problem. Specifically, we show that the correlation between
gradients in standard feedforward networks decays exponentially with depth
resulting in gradients that resemble white noise whereas, in contrast, the
gradients in architectures with skip-connections are far more resistant to
shattering, decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in
support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets.
Finally, we present a new ""looks linear"" (LL) initialization that prevents
shattering, with preliminary experiments showing the new initialization allows
to train very deep networks without the addition of skip-connections.
"
"  This paper considers the problem of autonomous multi-agent cooperative target
search in an unknown environment using a decentralized framework under a
no-communication scenario. The targets are considered as static targets and the
agents are considered to be homogeneous. The no-communication scenario
translates as the agents do not exchange either the information about the
environment or their actions among themselves. We propose an integrated
decision and control theoretic solution for a search problem which generates
feasible agent trajectories. In particular, a perception based algorithm is
proposed which allows an agent to estimate the probable strategies of other
agents' and to choose a decision based on such estimation. The algorithm shows
robustness with respect to the estimation accuracy to a certain degree. The
performance of the algorithm is compared with random strategies and numerical
simulation shows considerable advantages.
"
"  Developing neural network image classification models often requires
significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn
the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach
is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an
architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to
a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new
search space (the ""NASNet search space"") which enables transferability. In our
experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or ""cell"") on the
CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking
together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a
convolutional architecture, named ""NASNet architecture"". We also introduce a
new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly
improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, NASNet
achieves 2.4% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, NASNet
achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7% top-1
and 96.2% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2% better in top-1 accuracy than
the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a
reduction of 28% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art
model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of
NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For
instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74% top-1 accuracy, which is
3.1% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile
platforms. Finally, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN
framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0% achieving 43.1% mAP on the COCO
dataset.
"
"  We propose a new multi-frame method for efficiently computing scene flow
(dense depth and optical flow) and camera ego-motion for a dynamic scene
observed from a moving stereo camera rig. Our technique also segments out
moving objects from the rigid scene. In our method, we first estimate the
disparity map and the 6-DOF camera motion using stereo matching and visual
odometry. We then identify regions inconsistent with the estimated camera
motion and compute per-pixel optical flow only at these regions. This flow
proposal is fused with the camera motion-based flow proposal using fusion moves
to obtain the final optical flow and motion segmentation. This unified
framework benefits all four tasks - stereo, optical flow, visual odometry and
motion segmentation leading to overall higher accuracy and efficiency. Our
method is currently ranked third on the KITTI 2015 scene flow benchmark.
Furthermore, our CPU implementation runs in 2-3 seconds per frame which is 1-3
orders of magnitude faster than the top six methods. We also report a thorough
evaluation on challenging Sintel sequences with fast camera and object motion,
where our method consistently outperforms OSF [Menze and Geiger, 2015], which
is currently ranked second on the KITTI benchmark.
"
"  We present the mixed Galerkin discretization of distributed parameter
port-Hamiltonian systems. On the prototypical example of hyperbolic systems of
two conservation laws in arbitrary spatial dimension, we derive the main
contributions: (i) A weak formulation of the underlying geometric
(Stokes-Dirac) structure with a segmented boundary according to the causality
of the boundary ports. (ii) The geometric approximation of the Stokes-Dirac
structure by a finite-dimensional Dirac structure is realized using a mixed
Galerkin approach and power-preserving linear maps, which define minimal
discrete power variables. (iii) With a consistent approximation of the
Hamiltonian, we obtain finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian state space models.
By the degrees of freedom in the power-preserving maps, the resulting family of
structure-preserving schemes allows for trade-offs between centered
approximations and upwinding. We illustrate the method on the example of
Whitney finite elements on a 2D simplicial triangulation and compare the
eigenvalue approximation in 1D with a related approach.

"  Large-scale datasets have played a significant role in progress of neural
network and deep learning areas. YouTube-8M is such a benchmark dataset for
general multi-label video classification. It was created from over 7 million
YouTube videos (450,000 hours of video) and includes video labels from a
vocabulary of 4716 classes (3.4 labels/video on average). It also comes with
pre-extracted audio & visual features from every second of video (3.2 billion
feature vectors in total). Google cloud recently released the datasets and
organized 'Google Cloud & YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge' on Kaggle.
Competitors are challenged to develop classification algorithms that assign
video-level labels using the new and improved Youtube-8M V2 dataset. Inspired
by the competition, we started exploration of audio understanding and
classification using deep learning algorithms and ensemble methods. We built
several baseline predictions according to the benchmark paper and public github
tensorflow code. Furthermore, we improved global prediction accuracy (GAP) from
base level 77% to 80.7% through approaches of ensemble.
"
"  In this letter, we consider the joint power and admission control (JPAC)
problem by assuming that only the channel distribution information (CDI) is
available. Under this assumption, we formulate a new chance (probabilistic)
constrained JPAC problem, where the signal to interference plus noise ratio
(SINR) outage probability of the supported links is enforced to be not greater
than a prespecified tolerance. To efficiently deal with the chance SINR
constraint, we employ the sample approximation method to convert them into
finitely many linear constraints. Then, we propose a convex approximation based
deflation algorithm for solving the sample approximation JPAC problem. Compared
to the existing works, this letter proposes a novel two-timescale JPAC
approach, where admission control is performed by the proposed deflation
algorithm based on the CDI in a large timescale and transmission power is
adapted instantly with fast fadings in a small timescale. The effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulations.
"
"  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at creating realistic images
with complex models for which maximum likelihood is infeasible. However, the
convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two
time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient
descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions. TTUR has an individual learning rate
for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic
approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a
stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular
Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy
ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For
the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the
""Fréchet Inception Distance"" (FID) which captures the similarity of generated
images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, TTUR
improves learning for DCGANs and Improved Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP)
outperforming conventional GAN training on CelebA, CIFAR-10, SVHN, LSUN
Bedrooms, and the One Billion Word Benchmark.

"  Support vector machines (SVMs) are an important tool in modern data analysis.
Traditionally, support vector machines have been fitted via quadratic
programming, either using purpose-built or off-the-shelf algorithms. We present
an alternative approach to SVM fitting via the majorization--minimization (MM)
paradigm. Algorithms that are derived via MM algorithm constructions can be
shown to monotonically decrease their objectives at each iteration, as well as
be globally convergent to stationary points. We demonstrate the construction of
iteratively-reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithms, via the MM paradigm,
for SVM risk minimization problems involving the hinge, least-square,
squared-hinge, and logistic losses, and 1-norm, 2-norm, and elastic net
penalizations. Successful implementations of our algorithms are presented via
some numerical examples.
"
"  Estimating vaccination uptake is an integral part of ensuring public health.
It was recently shown that vaccination uptake can be estimated automatically
from web data, instead of slowly collected clinical records or population
surveys. All prior work in this area assumes that features of vaccination
uptake collected from the web are temporally regular. We present the first ever
method to remove this assumption from vaccination uptake estimation: our method
dynamically adapts to temporal fluctuations in time series web data used to
estimate vaccination uptake. We show our method to outperform the state of the
art compared to competitive baselines that use not only web data but also
curated clinical data. This performance improvement is more pronounced for
vaccines whose uptake has been irregular due to negative media attention (HPV-1
and HPV-2), problems in vaccine supply (DiTeKiPol), and targeted at children of
12 years old (whose vaccination is more irregular compared to younger
children).
"
"  The system that we study in this paper contains a set of users that observe a
discrete memoryless multiple source and communicate via noise-free channels
with the aim of attaining omniscience, the state that all users recover the
entire multiple source. We adopt the concept of successive omniscience (SO),
i.e., letting the local omniscience in some user subset be attained before the
global omniscience in the entire system, and consider the problem of how to
efficiently attain omniscience in a successive manner. Based on the existing
results on SO, we propose a CompSetSO algorithm for determining a complimentary
set, a user subset in which the local omniscience can be attained first without
increasing the sum-rate, the total number of communications, for the global
omniscience. We also derive a sufficient condition for a user subset to be
complimentary so that running the CompSetSO algorithm only requires a lower
bound, instead of the exact value, of the minimum sum-rate for attaining global
omniscience. The CompSetSO algorithm returns a complimentary user subset in
polynomial time. We show by example how to recursively apply the CompSetSO
algorithm so that the global omniscience can be attained by multi-stages of SO.

"  In this paper we present a novel methodology for identifying scholars with a
Twitter account. By combining bibliometric data from Web of Science and Twitter
users identified by Altmetric.com we have obtained the largest set of
individual scholars matched with Twitter users made so far. Our methodology
consists of a combination of matching algorithms, considering different
linguistic elements of both author names and Twitter names; followed by a
rule-based scoring system that weights the common occurrence of several
elements related with the names, individual elements and activities of both
Twitter users and scholars matched. Our results indicate that about 2% of the
overall population of scholars in the Web of Science is active on Twitter. By
domain we find a strong presence of researchers from the Social Sciences and
the Humanities. Natural Sciences is the domain with the lowest level of
scholars on Twitter. Researchers on Twitter also tend to be younger than those
that are not on Twitter. As this is a bibliometric-based approach, it is
important to highlight the reliance of the method on the number of publications
produced and tweeted by the scholars, thus the share of scholars on Twitter
ranges between 1% and 5% depending on their level of productivity. Further
research is suggested in order to improve and expand the methodology.
"
"  In many applications involving large dataset or online updating, stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) provides a scalable way to compute parameter estimates
and has gained increasing popularity due to its numerical convenience and
memory efficiency. While the asymptotic properties of SGD-based estimators have
been established decades ago, statistical inference such as interval estimation
remains much unexplored. The traditional resampling method such as the
bootstrap is not computationally feasible since it requires to repeatedly draw
independent samples from the entire dataset. The plug-in method is not
applicable when there are no explicit formulas for the covariance matrix of the
estimator. In this paper, we propose a scalable inferential procedure for
stochastic gradient descent, which, upon the arrival of each observation,
updates the SGD estimate as well as a large number of randomly perturbed SGD
estimates. The proposed method is easy to implement in practice. We establish
its theoretical properties for a general class of models that includes
generalized linear models and quantile regression models as special cases. The
finite-sample performance and numerical utility is evaluated by simulation
studies and two real data applications.

"  In the work of Peng et al. in 2012, a new measure was proposed for fault
diagnosis of systems: namely, g-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability, which
requires that any fault-free vertex has at least g fault-free neighbors in the
system. In this paper, we establish the g-good-neighbor conditional
diagnosability of locally twisted cubes under the PMC model and the MM^* model.
"
"  Categories of polymorphic lenses in computer science, and of open games in
compositional game theory, have a curious structure that is reminiscent of
compact closed categories, but differs in some crucial ways. Specifically they
have a family of morphisms that behave like the counits of a compact closed
category, but have no corresponding units; and they have a `partial' duality
that behaves like transposition in a compact closed category when it is
defined. We axiomatise this structure, which we refer to as a `teleological
category'. We precisely define a diagrammatic language suitable for these
categories, and prove a coherence theorem for them. This underpins the use of
diagrammatic reasoning in compositional game theory, which has previously been
used only informally.
"
"  We present an efficient algorithm to compute Euler characteristic curves of
gray scale images of arbitrary dimension. In various applications the Euler
characteristic curve is used as a descriptor of an image.
Our algorithm is the first streaming algorithm for Euler characteristic
curves. The usage of streaming removes the necessity to store the entire image
in RAM. Experiments show that our implementation handles terabyte scale images
on commodity hardware. Due to lock-free parallelism, it scales well with the
number of processor cores. Our software---CHUNKYEuler---is available as open
source on Bitbucket.
Additionally, we put the concept of the Euler characteristic curve in the
wider context of computational topology. In particular, we explain the
connection with persistence diagrams.
"
"  We propose a new Pareto Local Search Algorithm for the many-objective
combinatorial optimization. Pareto Local Search proved to be a very effective
tool in the case of the bi-objective combinatorial optimization and it was used
in a number of the state-of-the-art algorithms for problems of this kind. On
the other hand, the standard Pareto Local Search algorithm becomes very
inefficient for problems with more than two objectives. We build an effective
Many-Objective Pareto Local Search algorithm using three new mechanisms: the
efficient update of large Pareto archives with ND-Tree data structure, a new
mechanism for the selection of the promising solutions for the neighborhood
exploration, and a partial exploration of the neighborhoods. We apply the
proposed algorithm to the instances of two different problems, i.e. the
traveling salesperson problem and the traveling salesperson problem with
profits with up to 5 objectives showing high effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

"  We identify the components of bio-inspired artificial camouflage systems
including actuation, sensing, and distributed computation. After summarizing
recent results in understanding the physiology and system-level performance of
a variety of biological systems, we describe computational algorithms that can
generate similar patterns and have the potential for distributed
implementation. We find that the existing body of work predominately treats
component technology in an isolated manner that precludes a material-like
implementation that is scale-free and robust. We conclude with open research
challenges towards the realization of integrated camouflage solutions.

"  In this paper, we develop a position estimation system for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles formed by hardware and software. It is based on low-cost devices: GPS,
commercial autopilot sensors and dense optical flow algorithm implemented in an
onboard microcomputer. Comparative tests were conducted using our approach and
the conventional one, where only fusion of GPS and inertial sensors are used.
Experiments were conducted using a quadrotor in two flying modes: hovering and
trajectory tracking in outdoor environments. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with the conventional
approaches presented in the vast majority of commercial drones.
"
"  Linear time-periodic (LTP) dynamical systems frequently appear in the
modeling of phenomena related to fluid dynamics, electronic circuits, and
structural mechanics via linearization centered around known periodic orbits of
nonlinear models. Such LTP systems can reach orders that make repeated
simulation or other necessary analysis prohibitive, motivating the need for
model reduction.
We develop here an algorithmic framework for constructing reduced models that
retains the linear time-periodic structure of the original LTP system. Our
approach generalizes optimal approaches that have been established previously
for linear time-invariant (LTI) model reduction problems. We employ an
extension of the usual H2 Hardy space defined for the LTI setting to
time-periodic systems and within this broader framework develop an a posteriori
error bound expressible in terms of related LTI systems. Optimization of this
bound motivates our algorithm. We illustrate the success of our method on two
numerical examples.

"  Recently, digital music libraries have been developed and can be plainly
accessed. Latest research showed that current organization and retrieval of
music tracks based on album information are inefficient. Moreover, they
demonstrated that people use emotion tags for music tracks in order to search
and retrieve them. In this paper, we discuss separability of a set of emotional
labels, proposed in the categorical emotion expression, using Fisher's
separation theorem. We determine a set of adjectives to tag music parts: happy,
sad, relaxing, exciting, epic and thriller. Temporal, frequency and energy
features have been extracted from the music parts. It could be seen that the
maximum separability within the extracted features occurs between relaxing and
epic music parts. Finally, we have trained a classifier using Support Vector
Machines to automatically recognize and generate emotional labels for a music
part. Accuracy for recognizing each label has been calculated; where the
results show that epic music can be recognized more accurately (77.4%),
comparing to the other types of music.
"
"  One key requirement for effective supply chain management is the quality of
its inventory management. Various inventory management methods are typically
employed for different types of products based on their demand patterns,
product attributes, and supply network. In this paper, our goal is to develop
robust demand prediction methods for weather sensitive products at retail
stores. We employ historical datasets from Walmart, whose customers and markets
are often exposed to extreme weather events which can have a huge impact on
sales regarding the affected stores and products. We want to accurately predict
the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products around the time of
major weather events at 45 of Walmart retails locations in the U.S.
Intuitively, we may expect an uptick in the sales of umbrellas before a big
thunderstorm, but it is difficult for replenishment managers to predict the
level of inventory needed to avoid being out-of-stock or overstock during and
after that storm. While they rely on a variety of vendor tools to predict sales
around extreme weather events, they mostly employ a time-consuming process that
lacks a systematic measure of effectiveness. We employ all the methods critical
to any analytics project and start with data exploration. Critical features are
extracted from the raw historical dataset for demand forecasting accuracy and
robustness. In particular, we employ Artificial Neural Network for forecasting
demand for each product sold around the time of major weather events. Finally,
we evaluate our model to evaluate their accuracy and robustness.
"
"  The Gaussian kernel is a very popular kernel function used in many
machine-learning algorithms, especially in support vector machines (SVM). For
nonlinear training instances in machine learning, it often outperforms
polynomial kernels in model accuracy. We use Gaussian kernel profoundly in
formulating nonlinear classical SVM. In the recent research, P. Rebentrost
et.al. discuss a very elegant quantum version of least square support vector
machine using the quantum version of polynomial kernel, which is exponentially
faster than the classical counterparts. In this paper, we have demonstrated a
quantum version of the Gaussian kernel and analyzed its complexity in the
context of quantum SVM. Our analysis shows that the computational complexity of
the quantum Gaussian kernel is O(\epsilon^(-1)logN) with N-dimensional
instances and \epsilon with a Taylor remainder error term |R_m (\epsilon^(-1)
logN)|.
"
"  Security, privacy, and fairness have become critical in the era of data
science and machine learning. More and more we see that achieving universally
secure, private, and fair systems is practically impossible. We have seen for
example how generative adversarial networks can be used to learn about the
expected private training data; how the exploitation of additional data can
reveal private information in the original one; and how what looks like
unrelated features can teach us about each other. Confronted with this
challenge, in this paper we open a new line of research, where the security,
privacy, and fairness is learned and used in a closed environment. The goal is
to ensure that a given entity (e.g., the company or the government), trusted to
infer certain information with our data, is blocked from inferring protected
information from it. For example, a hospital might be allowed to produce
diagnosis on the patient (the positive task), without being able to infer the
gender of the subject (negative task). Similarly, a company can guarantee that
internally it is not using the provided data for any undesired task, an
important goal that is not contradicting the virtually impossible challenge of
blocking everybody from the undesired task. We design a system that learns to
succeed on the positive task while simultaneously fail at the negative one, and
illustrate this with challenging cases where the positive task is actually
harder than the negative one being blocked. Fairness, to the information in the
negative task, is often automatically obtained as a result of this proposed
approach. The particular framework and examples open the door to security,
privacy, and fairness in very important closed scenarios, ranging from private
data accumulation companies like social networks to law-enforcement and
hospitals.
"
"  The difficulty of modeling energy consumption in communication systems leads
to challenges in energy harvesting (EH) systems, in which nodes scavenge energy
from their environment. An EH receiver must harvest enough energy for
demodulating and decoding. The energy required depends upon factors, like code
rate and signal-to-noise ratio, which can be adjusted dynamically. We consider
a receiver which harvests energy from ambient sources and the transmitter,
meaning the received signal is used for both EH and information decoding.
Assuming a generalized function for energy consumption, we maximize the total
number of information bits decoded, under both average and peak power
constraints at the transmitter, by carefully optimizing the power used for EH,
power used for information transmission, fraction of time for EH, and code
rate. For transmission over a single block, we find there exist problem
parameters for which either maximizing power for information transmission or
maximizing power for EH is optimal. In the general case, the optimal solution
is a tradeoff of the two. For transmission over multiple blocks, we give an
upper bound on performance and give sufficient and necessary conditions to
achieve this bound. Finally, we give some numerical results to illustrate our
results and analysis.
"
"  A common problem in large-scale data analysis is to approximate a matrix
using a combination of specifically sampled rows and columns, known as CUR
decomposition. Unfortunately, in many real-world environments, the ability to
sample specific individual rows or columns of the matrix is limited by either
system constraints or cost. In this paper, we consider matrix approximation by
sampling predefined \emph{blocks} of columns (or rows) from the matrix. We
present an algorithm for sampling useful column blocks and provide novel
guarantees for the quality of the approximation. This algorithm has application
in problems as diverse as biometric data analysis to distributed computing. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for computing the
Block CUR decomposition of large matrices in a distributed setting with
multiple nodes in a compute cluster, where such blocks correspond to columns
(or rows) of the matrix stored on the same node, which can be retrieved with
much less overhead than retrieving individual columns stored across different
nodes. In the biometric setting, the rows correspond to different users and
columns correspond to users' biometric reaction to external stimuli, {\em
e.g.,}~watching video content, at a particular time instant. There is
significant cost in acquiring each user's reaction to lengthy content so we
sample a few important scenes to approximate the biometric response. An
individual time sample in this use case cannot be queried in isolation due to
the lack of context that caused that biometric reaction. Instead, collections
of time segments ({\em i.e.,} blocks) must be presented to the user. The
practical application of these algorithms is shown via experimental results
using real-world user biometric data from a content testing environment.
"
"  We present a new method for the automated synthesis of digital controllers
with formal safety guarantees for systems with nonlinear dynamics, noisy output
measurements, and stochastic disturbances. Our method derives digital
controllers such that the corresponding closed-loop system, modeled as a
sampled-data stochastic control system, satisfies a safety specification with
probability above a given threshold. The proposed synthesis method alternates
between two steps: generation of a candidate controller pc, and verification of
the candidate. pc is found by maximizing a Monte Carlo estimate of the safety
probability, and by using a non-validated ODE solver for simulating the system.
Such a candidate is therefore sub-optimal but can be generated very rapidly. To
rule out unstable candidate controllers, we prove and utilize Lyapunov's
indirect method for instability of sampled-data nonlinear systems. In the
subsequent verification step, we use a validated solver based on SMT
(Satisfiability Modulo Theories) to compute a numerically and statistically
valid confidence interval for the safety probability of pc. If the probability
so obtained is not above the threshold, we expand the search space for
candidates by increasing the controller degree. We evaluate our technique on
three case studies: an artificial pancreas model, a powertrain control model,
and a quadruple-tank process.

"  In the present paper we consider numerical methods to solve the discrete
Schrödinger equation with a time dependent Hamiltonian (motivated by problems
encountered in the study of spin systems). We will consider both short-range
interactions, which lead to evolution equations involving sparse matrices, and
long-range interactions, which lead to dense matrices. Both of these settings
show very different computational characteristics. We use Magnus integrators
for time integration and employ a framework based on Leja interpolation to
compute the resulting action of the matrix exponential. We consider both
traditional Magnus integrators (which are extensively used for these types of
problems in the literature) as well as the recently developed commutator-free
Magnus integrators and implement them on modern CPU and GPU (graphics
processing unit) based systems.
We find that GPUs can yield a significant speed-up (up to a factor of $10$ in
the dense case) for these types of problems. In the sparse case GPUs are only
advantageous for large problem sizes and the achieved speed-ups are more
modest. In most cases the commutator-free variant is superior but especially on
the GPU this advantage is rather small. In fact, none of the advantage of
commutator-free methods on GPUs (and on multi-core CPUs) is due to the
elimination of commutators. This has important consequences for the design of
more efficient numerical methods.

"  In processing human produced text using natural language processing (NLP)
techniques, two fundamental subtasks that arise are (i) segmentation of the
plain text into meaningful subunits (e.g., entities), and (ii) dependency
parsing, to establish relations between subunits. In this paper, we develop a
relatively simple and effective neural joint model that performs both
segmentation and dependency parsing together, instead of one after the other as
in most state-of-the-art works. We will focus in particular on the real estate
ad setting, aiming to convert an ad to a structured description, which we name
property tree, comprising the tasks of (1) identifying important entities of a
property (e.g., rooms) from classifieds and (2) structuring them into a tree
format. In this work, we propose a new joint model that is able to tackle the
two tasks simultaneously and construct the property tree by (i) avoiding the
error propagation that would arise from the subtasks one after the other in a
pipelined fashion, and (ii) exploiting the interactions between the subtasks.
For this purpose, we perform an extensive comparative study of the pipeline
methods and the new proposed joint model, reporting an improvement of over
three percentage points in the overall edge F1 score of the property tree.
Also, we propose attention methods, to encourage our model to focus on salient
tokens during the construction of the property tree. Thus we experimentally
demonstrate the usefulness of attentive neural architectures for the proposed
joint model, showcasing a further improvement of two percentage points in edge
F1 score for our application.

"  The novel unseen classes can be formulated as the extreme values of known
classes. This inspired the recent works on open-set recognition
\cite{Scheirer_2013_TPAMI,Scheirer_2014_TPAMIb,EVM}, which however can have no
way of naming the novel unseen classes. To solve this problem, we propose the
Extreme Value Learning (EVL) formulation to learn the mapping from visual
feature to semantic space. To model the margin and coverage distributions of
each class, the Vocabulary-informed Learning (ViL) is adopted by using vast
open vocabulary in the semantic space. Essentially, by incorporating the EVL
and ViL, we for the first time propose a novel semantic embedding paradigm --
Vocabulary-informed Extreme Value Learning (ViEVL), which embeds the visual
features into semantic space in a probabilistic way. The learned embedding can
be directly used to solve supervised learning, zero-shot and open set
recognition simultaneously. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of proposed frameworks.

"  In this paper, we study the performance of two cross-layer optimized dynamic
routing techniques for radio interference mitigation across multiple coexisting
wireless body area networks (BANs), based on real-life measurements. At the
network layer, the best route is selected according to channel state
information from the physical layer, associated with low duty cycle TDMA at the
MAC layer. The routing techniques (i.e., shortest path routing (SPR), and novel
cooperative multi-path routing (CMR) incorporating 3-branch selection
combining) perform real-time and reliable data transfer across BANs operating
near the 2.4 GHz ISM band. An open-access experimental data set of 'everyday'
mixed-activities is used for analyzing the proposed cross-layer optimization.
We show that CMR gains up to 14 dB improvement with 8.3% TDMA duty cycle, and
even 10 dB improvement with 0.2% TDMA duty cycle over SPR, at 10% outage
probability at a realistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).
Acceptable packet delivery ratios (PDR) and spectral efficiencies are obtained
from SPR and CMR with reasonably sensitive receivers across a range of TDMA low
duty cycles, with up to 9 dB improvement of CMR over SPR at 90% PDR. The
distribution fits for received SINR through routing are also derived and
validated with theoretical analysis.

"  In recent years, the proliferation of online resumes and the need to evaluate
large populations of candidates for on-site and virtual teams have led to a
growing interest in automated team-formation. Given a large pool of candidates,
the general problem requires the selection of a team of experts to complete a
given task. Surprisingly, while ongoing research has studied numerous
variations with different constraints, it has overlooked a factor with a
well-documented impact on team cohesion and performance: team faultlines.
Addressing this gap is challenging, as the available measures for faultlines in
existing teams cannot be efficiently applied to faultline optimization. In this
work, we meet this challenge with a new measure that can be efficiently used
for both faultline measurement and minimization. We then use the measure to
solve the problem of automatically partitioning a large population into
low-faultline teams. By introducing faultlines to the team-formation
literature, our work creates exciting opportunities for algorithmic work on
faultline optimization, as well as on work that combines and studies the
connection of faultlines with other influential team characteristics.

"  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved great
success in many visual recognition tasks. However, existing deep neural network
models are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their
deployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict
latency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model
compression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing
the model performance. During the past few years, tremendous progress has been
made in this area. In this paper, we survey the recent advanced techniques for
compacting and accelerating CNNs model developed. These techniques are roughly
categorized into four schemes: parameter pruning and sharing, low-rank
factorization, transferred/compact convolutional filters, and knowledge
distillation. Methods of parameter pruning and sharing will be described at the
beginning, after that the other techniques will be introduced. For each scheme,
we provide insightful analysis regarding the performance, related applications,
advantages, and drawbacks etc. Then we will go through a few very recent
additional successful methods, for example, dynamic capacity networks and
stochastic depths networks. After that, we survey the evaluation matrix, the
main datasets used for evaluating the model performance and recent benchmarking
efforts. Finally, we conclude this paper, discuss remaining challenges and
possible directions on this topic.

"  This paper is devoted to the study of the construction of new quantum MDS
codes. Based on constacyclic codes over Fq2 , we derive four new families of
quantum MDS codes, one of which is an explicit generalization of the
construction given in Theorem 7 in [22]. We also extend the result of Theorem
3:3 given in [17].
"
"  Recent advances in stochastic gradient techniques have made it possible to
estimate posterior distributions from large datasets via Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC). However, when the target posterior is multimodal, mixing
performance is often poor. This results in inadequate exploration of the
posterior distribution. A framework is proposed to improve the sampling
efficiency of stochastic gradient MCMC, based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. A
generalized kinetic function is leveraged, delivering superior stationary
mixing, especially for multimodal distributions. Techniques are also discussed
to overcome the practical issues introduced by this generalization. It is shown
that the proposed approach is better at exploring complex multimodal posterior
distributions, as demonstrated on multiple applications and in comparison with
other stochastic gradient MCMC methods.
"
"  This paper aims to explore models based on the extreme gradient boosting
(XGBoost) approach for business risk classification. Feature selection (FS)
algorithms and hyper-parameter optimizations are simultaneously considered
during model training. The five most commonly used FS methods including weight
by Gini, weight by Chi-square, hierarchical variable clustering, weight by
correlation, and weight by information are applied to alleviate the effect of
redundant features. Two hyper-parameter optimization approaches, random search
(RS) and Bayesian tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), are applied in
XGBoost. The effect of different FS and hyper-parameter optimization methods on
the model performance are investigated by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The
performance of XGBoost is compared to the traditionally utilized logistic
regression (LR) model in terms of classification accuracy, area under the curve
(AUC), recall, and F1 score obtained from the 10-fold cross validation. Results
show that hierarchical clustering is the optimal FS method for LR while weight
by Chi-square achieves the best performance in XG-Boost. Both TPE and RS
optimization in XGBoost outperform LR significantly. TPE optimization shows a
superiority over RS since it results in a significantly higher accuracy and a
marginally higher AUC, recall and F1 score. Furthermore, XGBoost with TPE
tuning shows a lower variability than the RS method. Finally, the ranking of
feature importance based on XGBoost enhances the model interpretation.
Therefore, XGBoost with Bayesian TPE hyper-parameter optimization serves as an
operative while powerful approach for business risk modeling.

"  Heart disease is the leading cause of death, and experts estimate that
approximately half of all heart attacks and strokes occur in people who have
not been flagged as ""at risk."" Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the
accuracy of heart disease diagnosis. To this end, we investigate the potential
of using data analysis, and in particular the design and use of deep neural
networks (DNNs) for detecting heart disease based on routine clinical data. Our
main contribution is the design, evaluation, and optimization of DNN
architectures of increasing depth for heart disease diagnosis. This work led to
the discovery of a novel five layer DNN architecture - named Heart Evaluation
for Algorithmic Risk-reduction and Optimization Five (HEARO-5) -- that yields
best prediction accuracy. HEARO-5's design employs regularization optimization
and automatically deals with missing data and/or data outliers. To evaluate and
tune the architectures we use k-way cross-validation as well as Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC) to measure the quality of our classifications.
The study is performed on the publicly available Cleveland dataset of medical
information, and we are making our developments open source, to further
facilitate openness and research on the use of DNNs in medicine. The HEARO-5
architecture, yielding 99% accuracy and 0.98 MCC, significantly outperforms
currently published research in the area.

"  The theory of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) allows verification of
stability and gain-bound properties of systems containing nonlinear or
uncertain elements. Gain bounds often imply exponential stability, but it can
be challenging to compute useful numerical bounds on the exponential decay
rate. This work presents a generalization of the classical IQC results of
Megretski and Rantzer that leads to a tractable computational procedure for
finding exponential rate certificates that are far less conservative than ones
computed from $L_2$ gain bounds alone. An expanded library of IQCs for
certifying exponential stability is also provided and the effectiveness of the
technique is demonstrated via numerical examples.
"
"  This paper mainly discusses the diffusion on complex networks with
time-varying couplings. We propose a model to describe the adaptive diffusion
process of local topological and dynamical information, and find that the
Barabasi-Albert scale-free network (BA network) is beneficial to the diffusion
and leads nodes to arrive at a larger state value than other networks do. The
ability of diffusion for a node is related to its own degree. Specifically,
nodes with smaller degrees are more likely to change their states and reach
larger values, while those with larger degrees tend to stick to their original
states. We introduce state entropy to analyze the thermodynamic mechanism of
the diffusion process, and interestingly find that this kind of diffusion
process is a minimization process of state entropy. We use the inequality
constrained optimization method to reveal the restriction function of the
minimization and find that it has the same form as the Gibbs free energy. The
thermodynamical concept allows us to understand dynamical processes on complex
networks from a brand-new perspective. The result provides a convenient means
of optimizing relevant dynamical processes on practical circuits as well as
related complex systems.
"
"  This paper proposes a non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion (VC) method
using a variant of the conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) called an
auxiliary classifier VAE (ACVAE). The proposed method has three key features.
First, it adopts fully convolutional architectures to construct the encoder and
decoder networks so that the networks can learn conversion rules that capture
time dependencies in the acoustic feature sequences of source and target
speech. Second, it uses an information-theoretic regularization for the model
training to ensure that the information in the attribute class label will not
be lost in the conversion process. With regular CVAEs, the encoder and decoder
are free to ignore the attribute class label input. This can be problematic
since in such a situation, the attribute class label will have little effect on
controlling the voice characteristics of input speech at test time. Such
situations can be avoided by introducing an auxiliary classifier and training
the encoder and decoder so that the attribute classes of the decoder outputs
are correctly predicted by the classifier. Third, it avoids producing
buzzy-sounding speech at test time by simply transplanting the spectral details
of the input speech into its converted version. Subjective evaluation
experiments revealed that this simple method worked reasonably well in a
non-parallel many-to-many speaker identity conversion task.
"
"  One of the popular approaches for low-rank tensor completion is to use the
latent trace norm regularization. However, most existing works in this
direction learn a sparse combination of tensors. In this work, we fill this gap
by proposing a variant of the latent trace norm that helps in learning a
non-sparse combination of tensors. We develop a dual framework for solving the
low-rank tensor completion problem. We first show a novel characterization of
the dual solution space with an interesting factorization of the optimal
solution. Overall, the optimal solution is shown to lie on a Cartesian product
of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we exploit the versatile Riemannian
optimization framework for proposing computationally efficient trust region
algorithm. The experiments illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on
several real-world datasets across applications.
"
"  X-ray computed tomography (CT) using sparse projection views is a recent
approach to reduce the radiation dose. However, due to the insufficient
projection views, an analytic reconstruction approach using the filtered back
projection (FBP) produces severe streaking artifacts. Recently, deep learning
approaches using large receptive field neural networks such as U-Net have
demonstrated impressive performance for sparse- view CT reconstruction.
However, theoretical justification is still lacking. Inspired by the recent
theory of deep convolutional framelets, the main goal of this paper is,
therefore, to reveal the limitation of U-Net and propose new multi-resolution
deep learning schemes. In particular, we show that the alternative U- Net
variants such as dual frame and the tight frame U-Nets satisfy the so-called
frame condition which make them better for effective recovery of high frequency
edges in sparse view- CT. Using extensive experiments with real patient data
set, we demonstrate that the new network architectures provide better
reconstruction performance.

"  This work bridges the technical concepts underlying distributed computing and
blockchain technologies with their profound socioeconomic and sociopolitical
implications, particularly on academic research and the healthcare industry.
Several examples from academia, industry, and healthcare are explored
throughout this paper. The limiting factor in contemporary life sciences
research is often funding: for example, to purchase expensive laboratory
equipment and materials, to hire skilled researchers and technicians, and to
acquire and disseminate data through established academic channels. In the case
of the U.S. healthcare system, hospitals generate massive amounts of data, only
a small minority of which is utilized to inform current and future medical
practice. Similarly, corporations too expend large amounts of money to collect,
secure and transmit data from one centralized source to another. In all three
scenarios, data moves under the traditional paradigm of centralization, in
which data is hosted and curated by individuals and organizations and of
benefit to only a small subset of people.
"
"  We propose Sparse Neural Network architectures that are based on random or
structured bipartite graph topologies. Sparse architectures provide compression
of the models learned and speed-ups of computations, they can also surpass
their unstructured or fully connected counterparts. As we show, even more
compact topologies of the so-called SNN (Sparse Neural Network) can be achieved
with the use of structured graphs of connections between consecutive layers of
neurons. In this paper, we investigate how the accuracy and training speed of
the models depend on the topology and sparsity of the neural network. Previous
approaches using sparcity are all based on fully connected neural network
models and create sparcity during training phase, instead we explicitly define
a sparse architectures of connections before the training. Building compact
neural network models is coherent with empirical observations showing that
there is much redundancy in learned neural network models. We show
experimentally that the accuracy of the models learned with neural networks
depends on expander-like properties of the underlying topologies such as the
spectral gap and algebraic connectivity rather than the density of the graphs
of connections.
"
"  Computer vision has made remarkable progress in recent years. Deep neural
network (DNN) models optimized to identify objects in images exhibit
unprecedented task-trained accuracy and, remarkably, some generalization
ability: new visual problems can now be solved more easily based on previous
learning. Biological vision (learned in life and through evolution) is also
accurate and general-purpose. Is it possible that these different learning
regimes converge to similar problem-dependent optimal computations? We
therefore asked whether the human system-level computation of visual perception
has DNN correlates and considered several anecdotal test cases. We found that
perceptual sensitivity to image changes has DNN mid-computation correlates,
while sensitivity to segmentation, crowding and shape has DNN end-computation
correlates. Our results quantify the applicability of using DNN computation to
estimate perceptual loss, and are consistent with the fascinating theoretical
view that properties of human perception are a consequence of
architecture-independent visual learning.
"
"  This paper provides short proofs of two fundamental theorems of finite
semigroup theory whose previous proofs were significantly longer, namely the
two-sided Krohn-Rhodes decomposition theorem and Henckell's aperiodic pointlike
theorem, using a new algebraic technique that we call the merge decomposition.
A prototypical application of this technique decomposes a semigroup $T$ into a
two-sided semidirect product whose components are built from two subsemigroups
$T_1,T_2$, which together generate $T$, and the subsemigroup generated by their
setwise product $T_1T_2$. In this sense we decompose $T$ by merging the
subsemigroups $T_1$ and $T_2$. More generally, our technique merges semigroup
homomorphisms from free semigroups.

"  Nefarious actors on social media and other platforms often spread rumors and
falsehoods through images whose metadata (e.g., captions) have been modified to
provide visual substantiation of the rumor/falsehood. This type of modification
is referred to as image repurposing, in which often an unmanipulated image is
published along with incorrect or manipulated metadata to serve the actor's
ulterior motives. We present the Multimodal Entity Image Repurposing (MEIR)
dataset, a substantially challenging dataset over that which has been
previously available to support research into image repurposing detection. The
new dataset includes location, person, and organization manipulations on
real-world data sourced from Flickr. We also present a novel, end-to-end, deep
multimodal learning model for assessing the integrity of an image by combining
information extracted from the image with related information from a knowledge
base. The proposed method is compared against state-of-the-art techniques on
existing datasets as well as MEIR, where it outperforms existing methods across
the board, with AUC improvement up to 0.23.
"
"  Recent advances in adversarial Deep Learning (DL) have opened up a largely
unexplored surface for malicious attacks jeopardizing the integrity of
autonomous DL systems. With the wide-spread usage of DL in critical and
time-sensitive applications, including unmanned vehicles, drones, and video
surveillance systems, online detection of malicious inputs is of utmost
importance. We propose DeepFense, the first end-to-end automated framework that
simultaneously enables efficient and safe execution of DL models. DeepFense
formalizes the goal of thwarting adversarial attacks as an optimization problem
that minimizes the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned
by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of
complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the
legitimacy of the input samples in parallel with the victim DL model. DeepFense
leverages hardware/software/algorithm co-design and customized acceleration to
achieve just-in-time performance in resource-constrained settings. The proposed
countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged
to train modular redundancies. We further provide an accompanying API to reduce
the non-recurring engineering cost and ensure automated adaptation to various
platforms. Extensive evaluations on FPGAs and GPUs demonstrate up to two orders
of magnitude performance improvement while enabling online adversarial sample
detection.
"
"  Users form information trails as they browse the web, checkin with a
geolocation, rate items, or consume media. A common problem is to predict what
a user might do next for the purposes of guidance, recommendation, or
prefetching. First-order and higher-order Markov chains have been widely used
methods to study such sequences of data. First-order Markov chains are easy to
estimate, but lack accuracy when history matters. Higher-order Markov chains,
in contrast, have too many parameters and suffer from overfitting the training
data. Fitting these parameters with regularization and smoothing only offers
mild improvements. In this paper we propose the retrospective higher-order
Markov process (RHOMP) as a low-parameter model for such sequences. This model
is a special case of a higher-order Markov chain where the transitions depend
retrospectively on a single history state instead of an arbitrary combination
of history states. There are two immediate computational advantages: the number
of parameters is linear in the order of the Markov chain and the model can be
fit to large state spaces. Furthermore, by providing a specific structure to
the higher-order chain, RHOMPs improve the model accuracy by efficiently
utilizing history states without risks of overfitting the data. We demonstrate
how to estimate a RHOMP from data and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on various real application datasets spanning geolocation data, review
sequences, and business locations. The RHOMP model uniformly outperforms
higher-order Markov chains, Kneser-Ney regularization, and tensor
factorizations in terms of prediction accuracy.
"
"  In this work, we investigate the value of uncertainty modeling in 3D
super-resolution with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Deep learning has
shown success in a plethora of medical image transformation problems, such as
super-resolution (SR) and image synthesis. However, the highly ill-posed nature
of such problems results in inevitable ambiguity in the learning of networks.
We propose to account for intrinsic uncertainty through a per-patch
heteroscedastic noise model and for parameter uncertainty through approximate
Bayesian inference in the form of variational dropout. We show that the
combined benefits of both lead to the state-of-the-art performance SR of
diffusion MR brain images in terms of errors compared to ground truth. We
further show that the reduced error scores produce tangible benefits in
downstream tractography. In addition, the probabilistic nature of the methods
naturally confers a mechanism to quantify uncertainty over the super-resolved
output. We demonstrate through experiments on both healthy and pathological
brains the potential utility of such an uncertainty measure in the risk
assessment of the super-resolved images for subsequent clinical use.
"
"  We present the first general purpose framework for marginal maximum a
posteriori estimation of probabilistic program variables. By using a series of
code transformations, the evidence of any probabilistic program, and therefore
of any graphical model, can be optimized with respect to an arbitrary subset of
its sampled variables. To carry out this optimization, we develop the first
Bayesian optimization package to directly exploit the source code of its
target, leading to innovations in problem-independent hyperpriors, unbounded
optimization, and implicit constraint satisfaction; delivering significant
performance improvements over prominent existing packages. We present
applications of our method to a number of tasks including engineering design
and parameter optimization.

"  $ \def\vecc#1{\boldsymbol{#1}} $We design a polynomial time algorithm that
for any weighted undirected graph $G = (V, E,\vecc w)$ and sufficiently large
$\delta > 1$, partitions $V$ into subsets $V_1, \ldots, V_h$ for some $h\geq
1$, such that
$\bullet$ at most $\delta^{-1}$ fraction of the weights are between clusters,
i.e. \[ w(E - \cup_{i = 1}^h E(V_i)) \lesssim \frac{w(E)}{\delta};\]
$\bullet$ the effective resistance diameter of each of the induced subgraphs
$G[V_i]$ is at most $\delta^3$ times the average weighted degree, i.e. \[
\max_{u, v \in V_i} \mathsf{Reff}_{G[V_i]}(u, v) \lesssim \delta^3 \cdot
\frac{|V|}{w(E)} \quad \text{ for all } i=1, \ldots, h.\]
In particular, it is possible to remove one percent of weight of edges of any
given graph such that each of the resulting connected components has effective
resistance diameter at most the inverse of the average weighted degree.
Our proof is based on a new connection between effective resistance and low
conductance sets. We show that if the effective resistance between two vertices
$u$ and $v$ is large, then there must be a low conductance cut separating $u$
from $v$. This implies that very mildly expanding graphs have constant
effective resistance diameter. We believe that this connection could be of
independent interest in algorithm design.

"  Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a reliable learning mechanism in which a
robot enhances its perceptual capabilities. Typically, in SSL a trusted,
primary sensor cue provides supervised training data to a secondary sensor cue.
In this article, a theoretical analysis is performed on the fusion of the
primary and secondary cue in a minimal model of SSL. A proof is provided that
determines the specific conditions under which it is favorable to perform
fusion. In short, it is favorable when (i) the prior on the target value is
strong or (ii) the secondary cue is sufficiently accurate. The theoretical
findings are validated with computational experiments. Subsequently, a
real-world case study is performed to investigate if fusion in SSL is also
beneficial when assumptions of the minimal model are not met. In particular, a
flying robot learns to map pressure measurements to sonar height measurements
and then fuses the two, resulting in better height estimation. Fusion is also
beneficial in the opposite case, when pressure is the primary cue. The analysis
and results are encouraging to study SSL fusion also for other robots and
sensors.

"  Heating, Ventilation, and Cooling (HVAC) systems are often the most
significant contributor to the energy usage, and the operational cost, of large
office buildings. Therefore, to understand the various factors affecting the
energy usage, and to optimize the operational efficiency of building HVAC
systems, energy analysts and architects often create simulations (e.g.,
EnergyPlus or DOE-2), of buildings prior to construction or renovation to
determine energy savings and quantify the Return-on-Investment (ROI). While
useful, these simulations usually use static HVAC control strategies such as
lowering room temperature at night, or reactive control based on simulated room
occupancy. Recently, advances have been made in HVAC control algorithms that
predict room occupancy. However, these algorithms depend on costly sensor
installations and the tradeoffs between predictive accuracy, energy savings,
comfort and expenses are not well understood. Current simulation frameworks do
not support easy analysis of these tradeoffs. Our contribution is a simulation
framework that can be used to explore this design space by generating objective
estimates of the energy savings and occupant comfort for different levels of
HVAC prediction and control performance. We validate our framework on a
real-world occupancy dataset spanning 6 months for 235 rooms in a large
university office building. Using the gold standard of energy use modeling and
simulation (Revit and Energy Plus), we compare the energy consumption and
occupant comfort in 29 independent simulations that explore our parameter
space. Our results highlight a number of potentially useful tradeoffs with
respect to energy savings, comfort, and algorithmic performance among
predictive, reactive, and static schedules, for a stakeholder of our building.

"  Tropical recurrent sequences are introduced satisfying a given vector (being
a tropical counterpart of classical linear recurrent sequences). We consider
the case when Newton polygon of the vector has a single (bounded) edge. In this
case there are periodic tropical recurrent sequences which are similar to
classical linear recurrent sequences. A question is studied when there exists a
non-periodic tropical recurrent sequence satisfying a given vector, and partial
answers are provided to this question. Also an algorithm is designed which
tests existence of non-periodic tropical recurrent sequences satisfying a given
vector with integer coordinates. Finally, we introduce a tropical entropy of a
vector and provide some bounds on it.
"
"  An interesting approach to analyzing neural networks that has received
renewed attention is to examine the equivalent kernel of the neural network.
This is based on the fact that a fully connected feedforward network with one
hidden layer, a certain weight distribution, an activation function, and an
infinite number of neurons can be viewed as a mapping into a Hilbert space. We
derive the equivalent kernels of MLPs with ReLU or Leaky ReLU activations for
all rotationally-invariant weight distributions, generalizing a previous result
that required Gaussian weight distributions. Additionally, the Central Limit
Theorem is used to show that for certain activation functions, kernels
corresponding to layers with weight distributions having $0$ mean and finite
absolute third moment are asymptotically universal, and are well approximated
by the kernel corresponding to layers with spherical Gaussian weights. In deep
networks, as depth increases the equivalent kernel approaches a pathological
fixed point, which can be used to argue why training randomly initialized
networks can be difficult. Our results also have implications for weight
initialization.
"
"  We explore whether useful temporal neural generative models can be learned
from sequential data without back-propagation through time. We investigate the
viability of a more neurocognitively-grounded approach in the context of
unsupervised generative modeling of sequences. Specifically, we build on the
concept of predictive coding, which has gained influence in cognitive science,
in a neural framework. To do so we develop a novel architecture, the Temporal
Neural Coding Network, and its learning algorithm, Discrepancy Reduction. The
underlying directed generative model is fully recurrent, meaning that it
employs structural feedback connections and temporal feedback connections,
yielding information propagation cycles that create local learning signals.
This facilitates a unified bottom-up and top-down approach for information
transfer inside the architecture. Our proposed algorithm shows promise on the
bouncing balls generative modeling problem. Further experiments could be
conducted to explore the strengths and weaknesses of our approach.
"
"  Dependently typed languages such as Coq are used to specify and verify the
full functional correctness of source programs. Type-preserving compilation can
be used to preserve these specifications and proofs of correctness through
compilation into the generated target-language programs. Unfortunately,
type-preserving compilation of dependent types is hard. In essence, the problem
is that dependent type systems are designed around high-level compositional
abstractions to decide type checking, but compilation interferes with the
type-system rules for reasoning about run-time terms.
We develop a type-preserving closure-conversion translation from the Calculus
of Constructions (CC) with strong dependent pairs ($\Sigma$ types)---a subset
of the core language of Coq---to a type-safe, dependently typed compiler
intermediate language named CC-CC. The central challenge in this work is how to
translate the source type-system rules for reasoning about functions into
target type-system rules for reasoning about closures. To justify these rules,
we prove soundness of CC-CC by giving a model in CC. In addition to type
preservation, we prove correctness of separate compilation.

"  Any generic closed curve in the plane can be transformed into a simple closed
curve by a finite sequence of local transformations called homotopy moves. We
prove that simplifying a planar closed curve with $n$ self-crossings requires
$\Theta(n^{3/2})$ homotopy moves in the worst case. Our algorithm improves the
best previous upper bound $O(n^2)$, which is already implicit in the classical
work of Steinitz; the matching lower bound follows from the construction of
closed curves with large defect, a topological invariant of generic closed
curves introduced by Aicardi and Arnold. Our lower bound also implies that
$\Omega(n^{3/2})$ facial electrical transformations are required to reduce any
plane graph with treewidth $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ to a single vertex, matching
known upper bounds for rectangular and cylindrical grid graphs. More generally,
we prove that transforming one immersion of $k$ circles with at most $n$
self-crossings into another requires $\Theta(n^{3/2} + nk + k^2)$ homotopy
moves in the worst case. Finally, we prove that transforming one
noncontractible closed curve to another on any orientable surface requires
$\Omega(n^2)$ homotopy moves in the worst case; this lower bound is tight if
the curve is homotopic to a simple closed curve.

"  Consider a channel with a given input distribution. Our aim is to degrade it
to a channel with at most L output letters. One such degradation method is the
so called ""greedy-merge"" algorithm. We derive an upper bound on the reduction
in mutual information between input and output. For fixed input alphabet size
and variable L, the upper bound is within a constant factor of an
algorithm-independent lower bound. Thus, we establish that greedy-merge is
optimal in the power-law sense.

"  One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect
of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal
action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, dynamics are
approximated by physics-based analytical models. These models rely on specific
state representations that may be hard to obtain from raw sensory data,
especially if no knowledge of the object shape is assumed. More recently, we
have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical
interactions directly from sensory input. It is however an open question how
far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we
investigate the advantages and limitations of neural network based learning
approaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and
show how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of
both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which
there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We
propose to use a convolutional neural network to convert raw depth images or
organized point clouds into a suitable representation for the analytical model
and compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and
prediction. A systematic evaluation of the proposed approach on a very large
real-world dataset shows two main advantages of the hybrid architecture.
Compared to a pure neural network, it significantly (i) reduces required
training data and (ii) improves generalization to novel physical interaction.

"  We derive the mean squared error convergence rates of kernel density-based
plug-in estimators of mutual information measures between two multidimensional
random variables $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ for two cases: 1) $\mathbf{X}$
and $\mathbf{Y}$ are both continuous; 2) $\mathbf{X}$ is continuous and
$\mathbf{Y}$ is discrete. Using the derived rates, we propose an ensemble
estimator of these information measures for the second case by taking a
weighted sum of the plug-in estimators with varied bandwidths. The resulting
ensemble estimator achieves the $1/N$ parametric convergence rate when the
conditional densities of the continuous variables are sufficiently smooth. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonparametric mutual information
estimator known to achieve the parametric convergence rate for this case, which
frequently arises in applications (e.g. variable selection in classification).
The estimator is simple to implement as it uses the solution to an offline
convex optimization problem and simple plug-in estimators. A central limit
theorem is also derived for the ensemble estimator. Ensemble estimators that
achieve the parametric rate are also derived for the first case ($\mathbf{X}$
and $\mathbf{Y}$ are both continuous) and another case 3) $\mathbf{X}$ and
$\mathbf{Y}$ may have any mixture of discrete and continuous components.

"  Widespread use of social media has led to the generation of substantial
amounts of information about individuals, including health-related information.
Social media provides the opportunity to study health-related information about
selected population groups who may be of interest for a particular study. In
this paper, we explore the possibility of utilizing social media to perform
targeted data collection and analysis from a particular population group --
pregnant women. We hypothesize that we can use social media to identify cohorts
of pregnant women and follow them over time to analyze crucial health-related
information. To identify potentially pregnant women, we employ simple
rule-based searches that attempt to detect pregnancy announcements with
moderate precision. To further filter out false positives and noise, we employ
a supervised classifier using a small number of hand-annotated data. We then
collect their posts over time to create longitudinal health timelines and
attempt to divide the timelines into different pregnancy trimesters. Finally,
we assess the usefulness of the timelines by performing a preliminary analysis
to estimate drug intake patterns of our cohort at different trimesters. Our
rule-based cohort identification technique collected 53,820 users over thirty
months from Twitter. Our pregnancy announcement classification technique
achieved an F-measure of 0.81 for the pregnancy class, resulting in 34,895 user
timelines. Analysis of the timelines revealed that pertinent health-related
information, such as drug-intake and adverse reactions can be mined from the
data. Our approach to using user timelines in this fashion has produced very
encouraging results and can be employed for other important tasks where
cohorts, for which health-related information may not be available from other
sources, are required to be followed over time to derive population-based
estimates.
"
"  We investigate how a neural network can learn perception actions loops for
navigation in unknown environments. Specifically, we consider how to learn to
navigate in environments populated with cul-de-sacs that represent convex local
minima that the robot could fall into instead of finding a set of feasible
actions that take it to the goal. Traditional methods rely on maintaining a
global map to solve the problem of over coming a long cul-de-sac. However, due
to errors induced from local and global drift, it is highly challenging to
maintain such a map for long periods of time. One way to mitigate this problem
is by using learning techniques that do not rely on hand engineered map
representations and instead output appropriate control policies directly from
their sensory input. We first demonstrate that such a problem cannot be solved
directly by deep reinforcement learning due to the sparse reward structure of
the environment. Further, we demonstrate that deep supervised learning also
cannot be used directly to solve this problem. We then investigate network
models that offer a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised
learning and highlight the significance of adding fully differentiable memory
units to such networks. We evaluate our networks on their ability to generalize
to new environments and show that adding memory to such networks offers huge
jumps in performance

"  Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a fast-emerging water desalination
technology in which a small cell voltage of ~1 V across porous carbon
electrodes removes salt from feedwaters via electrosorption. In flow-through
electrode (FTE) CDI cell architecture, feedwater is pumped through macropores
or laser perforated channels in porous electrodes, enabling highly compact
cells with parallel flow and electric field, as well as rapid salt removal. We
here present a one-dimensional model describing water desalination by FTE CDI,
and a comparison to data from a custom-built experimental cell. The model
employs simple cell boundary conditions derived via scaling arguments. We show
good model-to-data fits with reasonable values for fitting parameters such as
the Stern layer capacitance, micropore volume, and attraction energy. Thus, we
demonstrate that from an engineering modeling perspective, an FTE CDI cell may
be described with simpler one-dimensional models, unlike more typical
flow-between electrodes architecture where 2D models are required.

"  We present bilateral teleoperation system for task learning and robot motion
generation. Our system includes a bilateral teleoperation platform and a deep
learning software. The deep learning software refers to human demonstration
using the bilateral teleoperation platform to collect visual images and robotic
encoder values. It leverages the datasets of images and robotic encoder
information to learn about the inter-modal correspondence between visual images
and robot motion. In detail, the deep learning software uses a combination of
Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoders (DCAE) over image regions, and Recurrent
Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory units (LSTM-RNN) over robot motor
angles, to learn motion taught be human teleoperation. The learnt models are
used to predict new motion trajectories for similar tasks. Experimental results
show that our system has the adaptivity to generate motion for similar scooping
tasks. Detailed analysis is performed based on failure cases of the
experimental results. Some insights about the cans and cannots of the system
are summarized.

"  We propose two multimodal deep learning architectures that allow for
cross-modal dataflow (XFlow) between the feature extractors, thereby extracting
more interpretable features and obtaining a better representation than through
unimodal learning, for the same amount of training data. These models can
usefully exploit correlations between audio and visual data, which have a
different dimensionality and are therefore nontrivially exchangeable. Our work
improves on existing multimodal deep learning metholodogies in two essential
ways: (1) it presents a novel method for performing cross-modality (before
features are learned from individual modalities) and (2) extends the previously
proposed cross-connections, which only transfer information between streams
that process compatible data. Both cross-modal architectures outperformed their
baselines (by up to 7.5%) when evaluated on the AVletters dataset.

"  Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are infections acquired within the
hospital from healthcare workers, patients or from the environment, but which
have no connection to the initial reason for the patient's hospital admission.
HAI are a serious world-wide problem, leading to an increase in mortality
rates, duration of hospitalisation as well as significant economic burden on
hospitals. Although clear preventive guidelines exist, studies show that
compliance to them is frequently poor. This paper details the software
perspective for an innovative, business process software based cyber-physical
system that will be implemented as part of a European Union-funded research
project. The system is composed of a network of sensors mounted in different
sites around the hospital, a series of wearables used by the healthcare workers
and a server side workflow engine. For better understanding, we describe the
system through the lens of a single, simple clinical workflow that is
responsible for a significant portion of all hospital infections. The goal is
that when completed, the system will be configurable in the sense of
facilitating the creation and automated monitoring of those clinical workflows
that when combined, account for over 90\% of hospital infections.

"  We advocate the use of curated, comprehensive benchmark suites of machine
learning datasets, backed by standardized OpenML-based interfaces and
complementary software toolkits written in Python, Java and R. Major
distinguishing features of OpenML benchmark suites are (a) ease of use through
standardized data formats, APIs, and existing client libraries; (b)
machine-readable meta-information regarding the contents of the suite; and (c)
online sharing of results, enabling large scale comparisons. As a first such
suite, we propose the OpenML100, a machine learning benchmark suite of
100~classification datasets carefully curated from the thousands of datasets
available on OpenML.org.

"  Charts are an excellent way to convey patterns and trends in data, but they
do not facilitate further modeling of the data or close inspection of
individual data points. We present a fully automated system for extracting the
numerical values of data points from images of scatter plots. We use deep
learning techniques to identify the key components of the chart, and optical
character recognition together with robust regression to map from pixels to the
coordinate system of the chart. We focus on scatter plots with linear scales,
which already have several interesting challenges. Previous work has done fully
automatic extraction for other types of charts, but to our knowledge this is
the first approach that is fully automatic for scatter plots. Our method
performs well, achieving successful data extraction on 89% of the plots in our
test set.

"  Robots and automated systems are increasingly being introduced to unknown and
dynamic environments where they are required to handle disturbances, unmodeled
dynamics, and parametric uncertainties. Robust and adaptive control strategies
are required to achieve high performance in these dynamic environments. In this
paper, we propose a novel adaptive model predictive controller that combines
model predictive control (MPC) with an underlying $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive
controller to improve trajectory tracking of a system subject to unknown and
changing disturbances. The $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controller forces the
system to behave in a predefined way, as specified by a reference model. A
higher-level model predictive controller then uses this reference model to
calculate the optimal reference input based on a cost function, while taking
into account input and state constraints. We focus on the experimental
validation of the proposed approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in
experiments on a quadrotor. We show that the proposed approach has a lower
trajectory tracking error compared to non-predictive, adaptive approaches and a
predictive, non-adaptive approach, even when external wind disturbances are
applied.
"
"  With the use of ontologies in several domains such as semantic web,
information retrieval, artificial intelligence, the concept of similarity
measuring has become a very important domain of research. Therefore, in the
current paper, we propose our method of similarity measuring which uses the
Dijkstra algorithm to define and compute the shortest path. Then, we use this
one to compute the semantic distance between two concepts defined in the same
hierarchy of ontology. Afterward, we base on this result to compute the
semantic similarity. Finally, we present an experimental comparison between our
method and other methods of similarity measuring.

"  In this short note, we present a novel method for computing exact lower and
upper bounds of eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal interval matrix.
Compared to the known methods, our approach is fast, simple to present and to

matrices for which particular lower and upper bounds are attained.

"  Visualizing a complex network is computationally intensive process and
depends heavily on the number of components in the network. One way to solve
this problem is not to render the network in real time. PRE-render Content
Using Tiles (PRECUT) is a process to convert any complex network into a
pre-rendered network. Tiles are generated from pre-rendered images at different
zoom levels, and navigating the network simply becomes delivering relevant
tiles. PRECUT is exemplified by performing large-scale compound-target
relationship analyses. Matched molecular pair (MMP) networks were created using
compounds and the target class description found in the ChEMBL database. To

(Wikipedia Index - WI). Unlike the conventional existed citation indices, the
suggested mark allows to evaluate not only the popularity of the author, as it
can be done by means of calculating the general citation number or by the
Hirsch index, which is often used to measure the author's research rate. The
index gives an opportunity to estimate the author's popularity, his/her
influence within the sought-after area ""knowledge area"" in the Internet - in
the Wikipedia. The suggested index is supposed to be calculated in frames of

"  CMO Council reports that 71\% of internet users in the U.S. were influenced
by coupons and discounts when making their purchase decisions. It has also been
shown that offering coupons to a small fraction of users (called seed users)
may affect the purchase decisions of many other users in a social network. This
motivates us to study the optimal coupon allocation problem, and our objective
is to allocate coupons to a set of users so as to maximize the expected
cascade. Different from existing studies on influence maximizaton (IM), our
framework allows a general utility function and a more complex set of
constraints. In particular, we formulate our problem as an approximate
submodular maximization problem subject to matroid and knapsack constraints.
Existing techniques relying on the submodularity of the utility function, such
as greedy algorithm, can not work directly on a non-submodular function. We use
$\epsilon$ to measure the difference between our function and its closest
submodular function and propose a novel approximate algorithm with
approximation ratio $\beta(\epsilon)$ with $\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow
0}\beta(\epsilon)=1-1/e$. This is the best approximation guarantee for
approximate submodular maximization subject to a partition matroid and knapsack
constraints, our results apply to a broad range of optimization problems that
can be formulated as an approximate submodular maximization problem.

"  All possible removals of $n=5$ nodes from networks of size $N=100$ are
performed in order to find the optimal set of nodes which fragments the
original network into the smallest largest connected component. The resulting
attacks are ordered according to the size of the largest connected component
and compared with the state of the art methods of network attacks. We chose
attacks of size $5$ on relative small networks of size $100$ because the number
of all possible attacks, ${100}\choose{5}$ $\approx 10^8$, is at the verge of
the possible to compute with the available standard computers. Besides, we
applied the procedure in a series of networks with controlled and varied
modularity, comparing the resulting statistics with the effect of removing the
same amount of vertices, according to the known most efficient disruption
strategies, i.e., High Betweenness Adaptive attack (HBA), Collective Index
attack (CI), and Modular Based Attack (MBA). Results show that modularity has
an inverse relation with robustness, with $Q_c \approx 0.7$ being the critical
value. For modularities lower than $Q_c$, all heuristic method gives mostly the
same results than with random attacks, while for bigger $Q$, networks are less
robust and highly vulnerable to malicious attacks.
"
"  In this paper, we study stochastic non-convex optimization with non-convex
random functions. Recent studies on non-convex optimization revolve around
establishing second-order convergence, i.e., converging to a nearly
second-order optimal stationary points. However, existing results on stochastic
non-convex optimization are limited, especially with a high probability
second-order convergence. We propose a novel updating step (named NCG-S) by
leveraging a stochastic gradient and a noisy negative curvature of a stochastic
Hessian, where the stochastic gradient and Hessian are based on a proper
mini-batch of random functions. Building on this step, we develop two
algorithms and establish their high probability second-order convergence. To
the best of our knowledge, the proposed stochastic algorithms are the first
with a second-order convergence in {\it high probability} and a time complexity
that is {\it almost linear} in the problem's dimensionality.

"  Lower bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite
matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ play an important role in condition
number estimation and in iterative methods for singular value computation. In
particular, the bounds based on ${\rm Tr}(A^{-1})$ and ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})$
attract attention recently because they can be computed in $O(m)$ work when $A$
is tridiagonal. In this paper, we focus on these bounds and investigate their
properties in detail. First, we consider the problem of finding the optimal
bound that can be computed solely from ${\rm Tr}(A^{-1})$ and ${\rm
Tr}(A^{-2})$ and show that so called Laguerre's lower bound is the optimal one
in terms of sharpness. Next, we study the gap between the Laguerre bound and
the smallest eigenvalue. We characterize the situation in which the gap becomes
largest in terms of the eigenvalue distribution of $A$ and show that the gap
becomes smallest when ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})/\{{\rm Tr}(A^{-1})\}^2$ approaches 1 or
$\frac{1}{m}$. These results will be useful, for example, in designing
efficient shift strategies for singular value computation algorithms.
"
"  One advantage of decision tree based methods like random forests is their
ability to natively handle categorical predictors without having to first
transform them (e.g., by using feature engineering techniques). However, in
this paper, we show how this capability can lead to an inherent ""absent levels""
problem for decision tree based methods that has never been thoroughly
discussed, and whose consequences have never been carefully explored. This
problem occurs whenever there is an indeterminacy over how to handle an
observation that has reached a categorical split which was determined when the
observation in question's level was absent during training. Although these
incidents may appear to be innocuous, by using Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler's
random forests FORTRAN code and the randomForest R package (Liaw and Wiener,
2002) as motivating case studies, we examine how overlooking the absent levels
problem can systematically bias a model. Furthermore, by using three real data
examples, we illustrate how absent levels can dramatically alter a model's
performance in practice, and we empirically demonstrate how some simple
heuristics can be used to help mitigate the effects of the absent levels
problem until a more robust theoretical solution is found.

"  For decades, conventional computers based on the von Neumann architecture
have performed computation by repeatedly transferring data between their
processing and their memory units, which are physically separated. As
computation becomes increasingly data-centric and as the scalability limits in
terms of performance and power are being reached, alternative computing
paradigms are searched for in which computation and storage are collocated. A
fascinating new approach is that of computational memory where the physics of
nanoscale memory devices are used to perform certain computational tasks within
the memory unit in a non-von Neumann manner. Here we present a large-scale
experimental demonstration using one million phase-change memory devices
organized to perform a high-level computational primitive by exploiting the
crystallization dynamics. Also presented is an application of such a
computational memory to process real-world data-sets. The results show that
this co-existence of computation and storage at the nanometer scale could be
the enabler for new, ultra-dense, low power, and massively parallel computing
systems.

"  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn effective features, though
have been shown to suffer from a performance drop when the distribution of the
data changes from training to test data. In this paper we analyze the internal
representations of CNNs and observe that the representations of unseen data in
each class, spread more (with higher variance) in the embedding space of the
CNN compared to representations of the training data. More importantly, this
difference is more extreme if the unseen data comes from a shifted
distribution. Based on this observation, we objectively evaluate the degree of
representation's variance in each class via eigenvalue decomposition on the
within-class covariance of the internal representations of CNNs and observe the
same behaviour. This can be problematic as larger variances might lead to
mis-classification if the sample crosses the decision boundary of its class. We
apply nearest neighbor classification on the representations and empirically
show that the embeddings with the high variance actually have significantly
worse KNN classification performances, although this could not be foreseen from
their end-to-end classification results. To tackle this problem, we propose
Deep Within-Class Covariance Analysis (DWCCA), a deep neural network layer that
significantly reduces the within-class covariance of a DNN's representation,
improving performance on unseen test data from a shifted distribution. We
empirically evaluate DWCCA on two datasets for Acoustic Scene Classification
(DCASE2016 and DCASE2017). We demonstrate that not only does DWCCA
significantly improve the network's internal representation, it also increases
the end-to-end classification accuracy, especially when the test set exhibits a
distribution shift. By adding DWCCA to a VGG network, we achieve around 6
percentage points improvement in the case of a distribution mismatch.

"  Swarm systems constitute a challenging problem for reinforcement learning
(RL) as the algorithm needs to learn decentralized control policies that can
cope with limited local sensing and communication abilities of the agents.
While it is often difficult to directly define the behavior of the agents,
simple communication protocols can be defined more easily using prior knowledge
about the given task. In this paper, we propose a number of simple
communication protocols that can be exploited by deep reinforcement learning to
find decentralized control policies in a multi-robot swarm environment. The
protocols are based on histograms that encode the local neighborhood relations
of the agents and can also transmit task-specific information, such as the
shortest distance and direction to a desired target. In our framework, we use
an adaptation of Trust Region Policy Optimization to learn complex
collaborative tasks, such as formation building and building a communication
link. We evaluate our findings in a simulated 2D-physics environment, and
compare the implications of different communication protocols.

"  Controlling embodied agents with many actuated degrees of freedom is a
challenging task. We propose a method that can discover and interpolate between
context dependent high-level actions or body-affordances. These provide an
abstract, low-dimensional interface indexing high-dimensional and time-
extended action policies. Our method is related to recent ap- proaches in the
machine learning literature but is conceptually simpler and easier to
implement. More specifically our method requires the choice of a n-dimensional
target sensor space that is endowed with a distance metric. The method then
learns an also n-dimensional embedding of possibly reactive body-affordances
that spread as far as possible throughout the target sensor space.

"  Recently software development companies started to embrace Machine Learning
(ML) techniques for introducing a series of advanced functionality in their
products such as personalisation of the user experience, improved search,
content recommendation and automation. The technical challenges for tackling
these problems are heavily researched in literature. A less studied area is a
pragmatic approach to the role of humans in a complex modern industrial
environment where ML based systems are developed. Key stakeholders affect the
system from inception and up to operation and maintenance. Product managers
want to embed ""smart"" experiences for their users and drive the decisions on
what should be built next; software engineers are challenged to build or
utilise ML software tools that require skills that are well outside of their
comfort zone; legal and risk departments may influence design choices and data
access; operations teams are requested to maintain ML systems which are
non-stationary in their nature and change behaviour over time; and finally ML
practitioners should communicate with all these stakeholders to successfully
build a reliable system. This paper discusses some of the challenges we faced
in Atlassian as we started investing more in the ML space.

"  In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep architecture that jointly learns
to detect obstacles and estimate their depth for MAV flight applications. Most
of the existing approaches either rely on Visual SLAM systems or on depth
estimation models to build 3D maps and detect obstacles. However, for the task
of avoiding obstacles this level of complexity is not required. Recent works
have proposed multi task architectures to both perform scene understanding and
depth estimation. We follow their track and propose a specific architecture to
jointly estimate depth and obstacles, without the need to compute a global map,
but maintaining compatibility with a global SLAM system if needed. The network
architecture is devised to exploit the joint information of the obstacle
detection task, that produces more reliable bounding boxes, with the depth
estimation one, increasing the robustness of both to scenario changes. We call
this architecture J-MOD$^{2}$. We test the effectiveness of our approach with
experiments on sequences with different appearance and focal lengths and
compare it to SotA multi task methods that jointly perform semantic
segmentation and depth estimation. In addition, we show the integration in a
full system using a set of simulated navigation experiments where a MAV
explores an unknown scenario and plans safe trajectories by using our detection
model.

"  We present novel oblivious routing algorithms for both splittable and
unsplittable multicommodity flow. Our algorithm for minimizing congestion for
\emph{unsplittable} multicommodity flow is the first oblivious routing
algorithm for this setting. As an intermediate step towards this algorithm, we
present a novel generalization of Valiant's classical load balancing scheme for
packet-switched networks to arbitrary graphs, which is of independent interest.
Our algorithm for minimizing congestion for \emph{splittable} multicommodity
flow improves upon the state-of-the-art, in terms of both running time and
performance, for graphs that exhibit good expansion guarantees. Our algorithms
rely on diffusing traffic via iterative applications of the random walk
operator. Consequently, the performance guarantees of our algorithms are
derived from the convergence of the random walk operator to the stationary
distribution and are expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the graph (which
dominates the mixing time).

"  Machine learning classifiers are known to be vulnerable to inputs maliciously
constructed by adversaries to force misclassification. Such adversarial
examples have been extensively studied in the context of computer vision
applications. In this work, we show adversarial attacks are also effective when
targeting neural network policies in reinforcement learning. Specifically, we
show existing adversarial example crafting techniques can be used to
significantly degrade test-time performance of trained policies. Our threat
model considers adversaries capable of introducing small perturbations to the
raw input of the policy. We characterize the degree of vulnerability across
tasks and training algorithms, for a subclass of adversarial-example attacks in
white-box and black-box settings. Regardless of the learned task or training
algorithm, we observe a significant drop in performance, even with small
adversarial perturbations that do not interfere with human perception. Videos

"  In the past decade, the information security and threat landscape has grown
significantly making it difficult for a single defender to defend against all
attacks at the same time. This called for introduc- ing information sharing, a
paradigm in which threat indicators are shared in a community of trust to
facilitate defenses. Standards for representation, exchange, and consumption of
indicators are pro- posed in the literature, although various issues are
undermined. In this paper, we rethink information sharing for actionable
intelli- gence, by highlighting various issues that deserve further explo-
ration. We argue that information sharing can benefit from well- defined use
models, threat models, well-understood risk by mea- surement and robust
scoring, well-understood and preserved pri- vacy and quality of indicators and
robust mechanism to avoid free riding behavior of selfish agent. We call for
using the differential nature of data and community structures for optimizing
sharing.

"  The $p$-set, which is in a simple analytic form, is well distributed in unit
cubes. The well-known Weil's exponential sum theorem presents an upper bound of
the exponential sum over the $p$-set. Based on the result, one shows that the
$p$-set performs well in numerical integration, in compressed sensing as well
as in UQ. However, $p$-set is somewhat rigid since the cardinality of the
$p$-set is a prime $p$ and the set only depends on the prime number $p$. The
purpose of this paper is to present generalizations of $p$-sets, say
$\mathcal{P}_{d,p}^{{\mathbf a},\epsilon}$, which is more flexible.
Particularly, when a prime number $p$ is given, we have many different choices
of the new $p$-sets. Under the assumption that Goldbach conjecture holds, for
any even number $m$, we present a point set, say ${\mathcal L}_{p,q}$, with
cardinality $m-1$ by combining two different new $p$-sets, which overcomes a
major bottleneck of the $p$-set. We also present the upper bounds of the
exponential sums over $\mathcal{P}_{d,p}^{{\mathbf a},\epsilon}$ and ${\mathcal
L}_{p,q}$, which imply these sets have many potential applications.

"  This work proposes a new algorithm for training a re-weighted L2 Support
Vector Machine (SVM), inspired on the re-weighted Lasso algorithm of Candès
et al. and on the equivalence between Lasso and SVM shown recently by Jaggi. In
particular, the margin required for each training vector is set independently,
defining a new weighted SVM model. These weights are selected to be binary, and
they are automatically adapted during the training of the model, resulting in a
variation of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm with essentially the same
computational complexity as the original algorithm. As shown experimentally,
this algorithm is computationally cheaper to apply since it requires less
iterations to converge, and it produces models with a sparser representation in
terms of support vectors and which are more stable with respect to the
selection of the regularization hyper-parameter.

"  Learning-based approaches to robotic manipulation are limited by the
scalability of data collection and accessibility of labels. In this paper, we
present a multi-task domain adaptation framework for instance grasping in
cluttered scenes by utilizing simulated robot experiments. Our neural network
takes monocular RGB images and the instance segmentation mask of a specified
target object as inputs, and predicts the probability of successfully grasping
the specified object for each candidate motor command. The proposed transfer
learning framework trains a model for instance grasping in simulation and uses
a domain-adversarial loss to transfer the trained model to real robots using
indiscriminate grasping data, which is available both in simulation and the
real world. We evaluate our model in real-world robot experiments, comparing it
with alternative model architectures as well as an indiscriminate grasping
baseline.

"  Developing and testing algorithms for autonomous vehicles in real world is an
expensive and time consuming process. Also, in order to utilize recent advances
in machine intelligence and deep learning we need to collect a large amount of
annotated training data in a variety of conditions and environments. We present
a new simulator built on Unreal Engine that offers physically and visually
realistic simulations for both of these goals. Our simulator includes a physics
engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop
(HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The
simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new
types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the
modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in
other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor
as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software
components with real-world flights.

"  Brain-Machine Interaction (BMI) system motivates interesting and promising
results in forward/feedback control consistent with human intention. It holds
great promise for advancements in patient care and applications to
neurorehabilitation. Here, we propose a novel neurofeedback-based BCI robotic
platform using a personalized social robot in order to assist patients having
cognitive deficits through bilateral rehabilitation and mental training. For
initial testing of the platform, electroencephalography (EEG) brainwaves of a
human user were collected in real time during tasks of imaginary movements.
First, the brainwaves associated with imagined body kinematics parameters were
decoded to control a cursor on a computer screen in training protocol. Then,
the experienced subject was able to interact with a social robot via our
real-time BMI robotic platform. Corresponding to subject's imagery performance,
he/she received specific gesture movements and eye color changes as
neural-based feedback from the robot. This hands-free neurofeedback interaction
not only can be used for mind control of a social robot's movements, but also
sets the stage for application to enhancing and recovering mental abilities
such as attention via training in humans by providing real-time neurofeedback
from a social robot.

"  Road networks in cities are massive and is a critical component of mobility.
Fast response to defects, that can occur not only due to regular wear and tear
but also because of extreme events like storms, is essential. Hence there is a
need for an automated system that is quick, scalable and cost-effective for
gathering information about defects. We propose a system for city-scale road
audit, using some of the most recent developments in deep learning and semantic
segmentation. For building and benchmarking the system, we curated a dataset
which has annotations required for road defects. However, many of the labels
required for road audit have high ambiguity which we overcome by proposing a
label hierarchy. We also propose a multi-step deep learning model that segments
the road, subdivide the road further into defects, tags the frame for each
defect and finally localizes the defects on a map gathered using GPS. We
analyze and evaluate the models on image tagging as well as segmentation at
different levels of the label hierarchy.
"
"  Theory of Mind is the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, intents,
knowledge, perspectives, etc.) to others and recognize that these mental states
may differ from one's own. Theory of Mind is critical to effective
communication and to teams demonstrating higher collective performance. To
effectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make our
lives more productive, it is important for humans and AI to work well together
in a team. Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to make AI
more accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it better understand human
intentions, tendencies, beliefs, and contexts. The latter involves making AI
more human-like and having it develop a theory of our minds. In this work, we
argue that for human-AI teams to be effective, humans must also develop a
theory of AI's mind (ToAIM) - get to know its strengths, weaknesses, beliefs,
and quirks. We instantiate these ideas within the domain of Visual Question
Answering (VQA). We find that using just a few examples (50), lay people can be
trained to better predict responses and oncoming failures of a complex VQA
model. We further evaluate the role existing explanation (or interpretability)
modalities play in helping humans build ToAIM. Explainable AI has received
considerable scientific and popular attention in recent times. Surprisingly, we
find that having access to the model's internal states - its confidence in its
top-k predictions, explicit or implicit attention maps which highlight regions
in the image (and words in the question) the model is looking at (and listening
to) while answering a question about an image - do not help people better
predict its behavior.
"
"  Wireless backhaul communication has been recently realized with large
antennas operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band and
implementing highly directional beamforming. In this paper, we focus on the
alignment problem of narrow beams between fixed position network nodes in
mmWave backhaul systems that are subject to small displacements due to wind
flow or ground vibration. We consider nodes equipped with antenna arrays that
are capable of performing only analog processing and communicate through
wireless channels including a line-of-sight component. Aiming at minimizing the
time needed to achieve beam alignment, we present an efficient method that
capitalizes on the exchange of position information between the nodes to design
their beamforming and combining vectors. Some numerical results on the outage
probability with the proposed beam alignment method offer useful preliminary
insights on the impact of some system and operation parameters.
"
"  Feature engineering has been the key to the success of many prediction
models. However, the process is non-trivial and often requires manual feature
engineering or exhaustive searching. DNNs are able to automatically learn
feature interactions; however, they generate all the interactions implicitly,
and are not necessarily efficient in learning all types of cross features. In
this paper, we propose the Deep & Cross Network (DCN) which keeps the benefits
of a DNN model, and beyond that, it introduces a novel cross network that is
more efficient in learning certain bounded-degree feature interactions. In
particular, DCN explicitly applies feature crossing at each layer, requires no
manual feature engineering, and adds negligible extra complexity to the DNN
model. Our experimental results have demonstrated its superiority over the
state-of-art algorithms on the CTR prediction dataset and dense classification
dataset, in terms of both model accuracy and memory usage.
"
"  A number of fundamental quantities in statistical signal processing and
information theory can be expressed as integral functions of two probability
density functions. Such quantities are called density functionals as they map
density functions onto the real line. For example, information divergence
functions measure the dissimilarity between two probability density functions
and are useful in a number of applications. Typically, estimating these
quantities requires complete knowledge of the underlying distribution followed
by multi-dimensional integration. Existing methods make parametric assumptions
about the data distribution or use non-parametric density estimation followed
by high-dimensional integration. In this paper, we propose a new alternative.
We introduce the concept of ""data-driven basis functions"" - functions of
distributions whose value we can estimate given only samples from the
underlying distributions without requiring distribution fitting or direct
integration. We derive a new data-driven complete basis that is similar to the
deterministic Bernstein polynomial basis and develop two methods for performing
basis expansions of functionals of two distributions. We also show that the new
basis set allows us to approximate functions of distributions as closely as
desired. Finally, we evaluate the methodology by developing data driven
estimators for the Kullback-Leibler divergences and the Hellinger distance and
by constructing empirical estimates of tight bounds on the Bayes error rate.
"
"  The Tu--Deng Conjecture is concerned with the sum of digits $w(n)$ of $n$ in
base~$2$ (the Hamming weight of the binary expansion of $n$) and states the
following: assume that $k$ is a positive integer and $1\leq t<2^k-1$. Then
\[\Bigl \lvert\Bigl\{(a,b)\in\bigl\{0,\ldots,2^k-2\bigr\}^2:a+b\equiv t\bmod
2^k-1, w(a)+w(b)<k\Bigr\}\Bigr \rvert\leq 2^{k-1}.\]
We prove that the Tu--Deng Conjecture holds almost surely in the following
sense: the proportion of $t\in[1,2^k-2]$ such that the above inequality holds
approaches $1$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$.
Moreover, we prove that the Tu--Deng Conjecture implies a conjecture due to
T.~W.~Cusick concerning the sum of digits of $n$ and $n+t$.
"
"  In this paper, we made an extension to the convergence analysis of the
dynamics of two-layered bias-free networks with one $ReLU$ output. We took into
consideration two popular regularization terms: the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm
of the parameter vector $w$, and added it to the square loss function with
coefficient $\lambda/2$. We proved that when $\lambda$ is small, the weight
vector $w$ converges to the optimal solution $\hat{w}$ (with respect to the new
loss function) with probability $\geq (1-\varepsilon)(1-A_d)/2$ under random
initiations in a sphere centered at the origin, where $\varepsilon$ is a small
value and $A_d$ is a constant. Numerical experiments including phase diagrams
and repeated simulations verified our theory.
"
"  Marker-based and marker-less optical skeletal motion-capture methods use an
outside-in arrangement of cameras placed around a scene, with viewpoints
converging on the center. They often create discomfort by possibly needed
marker suits, and their recording volume is severely restricted and often
constrained to indoor scenes with controlled backgrounds. We therefore propose
a new method for real-time, marker-less and egocentric motion capture which
estimates the full-body skeleton pose from a lightweight stereo pair of fisheye
cameras that are attached to a helmet or virtual-reality headset. It combines
the strength of a new generative pose estimation framework for fisheye views
with a ConvNet-based body-part detector trained on a new automatically
annotated and augmented dataset. Our inside-in method captures full-body motion
in general indoor and outdoor scenes, and also crowded scenes.
"
"  Fundamental relations between information and estimation have been
established in the literature for the continuous-time Gaussian and Poisson
channels, in a long line of work starting from the classical representation
theorems by Duncan and Kabanov respectively. In this work, we demonstrate that
such relations hold for a much larger family of continuous-time channels. We
introduce the family of semi-martingale channels where the channel output is a
semi-martingale stochastic process, and the channel input modulates the
characteristics of the semi-martingale. For these channels, which includes as a
special case the continuous time Gaussian and Poisson models, we establish new
representations relating the mutual information between the channel input and
output to an optimal causal filtering loss, thereby unifying and considerably
extending results from the Gaussian and Poisson settings. Extensions to the
setting of mismatched estimation are also presented where the relative entropy
between the laws governing the output of the channel under two different input
distributions is equal to the cumulative difference between the estimation loss
incurred by using the mismatched and optimal causal filters respectively. The
main tool underlying these results is the Doob--Meyer decomposition of a class
of likelihood ratio sub-martingales. The results in this work can be viewed as
the continuous-time analogues of recent generalizations for relations between
information and estimation for discrete-time Lévy channels.
"
"  We study the min-cost seed selection problem in online social networks, where
the goal is to select a set of seed nodes with the minimum total cost such that
the expected number of influenced nodes in the network exceeds a predefined
threshold. We propose several algorithms that outperform the previous studies
both on the theoretical approximation ratios and on the experimental
performance. Under the case where the nodes have heterogeneous costs, our
algorithms are the first bi- criteria approximation algorithms with polynomial
running time and provable logarithmic performance bounds using a general
contagion model. Under the case where the users have uniform costs, our
algorithms achieve logarithmic approximation ratio and provable time complexity
which is smaller than that of existing algorithms in orders of magnitude. We
conduct extensive experiments using real social networks. The experimental
results show that, our algorithms significantly outperform the existing
algorithms both on the total cost and on the running time, and also scale well
to billion-scale networks.
"
"  We propose a new splitting criterion for a meta-learning approach to
multiclass classifier design that adaptively merges the classes into a
tree-structured hierarchy of increasingly difficult binary classification
problems. The classification tree is constructed from empirical estimates of
the Henze-Penrose bounds on the pairwise Bayes misclassification rates that
rank the binary subproblems in terms of difficulty of classification. The
proposed empirical estimates of the Bayes error rate are computed from the
minimal spanning tree (MST) of the samples from each pair of classes. Moreover,
a meta-learning technique is presented for quantifying the one-vs-rest Bayes
error rate for each individual class from a single MST on the entire dataset.
Extensive simulations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed hierarchical
method can often be learned much faster than competing methods, while achieving
competitive accuracy.
"
"  In this work, we present a methodology that enables an agent to make
efficient use of its exploratory actions by autonomously identifying possible
objectives in its environment and learning them in parallel. The identification
of objectives is achieved using an online and unsupervised adaptive clustering
algorithm. The identified objectives are learned (at least partially) in
parallel using Q-learning. Using a simulated agent and environment, it is shown
that the converged or partially converged value function weights resulting from
off-policy learning can be used to accumulate knowledge about multiple
objectives without any additional exploration. We claim that the proposed
approach could be useful in scenarios where the objectives are initially
unknown or in real world scenarios where exploration is typically a time and
energy intensive process. The implications and possible extensions of this work
are also briefly discussed.
"
"  Recent studies on diffusion-based sampling methods have shown that Langevin
Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms can be beneficial for non-convex optimization, and
rigorous theoretical guarantees have been proven for both asymptotic and
finite-time regimes. Algorithmically, LMC-based algorithms resemble the
well-known gradient descent (GD) algorithm, where the GD recursion is perturbed
by an additive Gaussian noise whose variance has a particular form. Fractional
Langevin Monte Carlo (FLMC) is a recently proposed extension of LMC, where the
Gaussian noise is replaced by a heavy-tailed {\alpha}-stable noise. As opposed
to its Gaussian counterpart, these heavy-tailed perturbations can incur large
jumps and it has been empirically demonstrated that the choice of
{\alpha}-stable noise can provide several advantages in modern machine learning
problems, both in optimization and sampling contexts. However, as opposed to
LMC, only asymptotic convergence properties of FLMC have been yet established.
In this study, we analyze the non-asymptotic behavior of FLMC for non-convex
optimization and prove finite-time bounds for its expected suboptimality. Our
results show that the weak-error of FLMC increases faster than LMC, which
suggests using smaller step-sizes in FLMC. We finally extend our results to the
case where the exact gradients are replaced by stochastic gradients and show
that similar results hold in this setting as well.

"  We use automatic speech recognition to assess spoken English learner
pronunciation based on the authentic intelligibility of the learners' spoken
responses determined from support vector machine (SVM) classifier or deep
learning neural network model predictions of transcription correctness. Using
numeric features produced by PocketSphinx alignment mode and many recognition
passes searching for the substitution and deletion of each expected phoneme and
insertion of unexpected phonemes in sequence, the SVM models achieve 82 percent
agreement with the accuracy of Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworker
transcriptions, up from 75 percent reported by multiple independent
researchers. Using such features with SVM classifier probability prediction
models can help computer-aided pronunciation teaching (CAPT) systems provide
intelligibility remediation.

"  A hybrid mobile/fixed device cloud that harnesses sensing, computing,
communication, and storage capabilities of mobile and fixed devices in the
field as well as those of computing and storage servers in remote datacenters
is envisioned. Mobile device clouds can be harnessed to enable innovative
pervasive applications that rely on real-time, in-situ processing of sensor
data collected in the field. To support concurrent mobile applications on the
device cloud, a robust and secure distributed computing framework, called
Maestro, is proposed. The key components of Maestro are (i) a task scheduling
mechanism that employs controlled task replication in addition to task
reallocation for robustness and (ii) Dedup for task deduplication among
concurrent pervasive workflows. An architecture-based solution that relies on
task categorization and authorized access to the categories of tasks is
proposed for different levels of protection. Experimental evaluation through
prototype testbed of Android- and Linux-based mobile devices as well as
simulations is performed to demonstrate Maestro's capabilities.
"
"  Choi et. al (2011) introduced a minimum spanning tree (MST)-based method
called CLGrouping, for constructing tree-structured probabilistic graphical
models, a statistical framework that is commonly used for inferring
phylogenetic trees. While CLGrouping works correctly if there is a unique MST,
we observe an indeterminacy in the method in the case that there are multiple
MSTs. In this work we remove this indeterminacy by introducing so-called
vertex-ranked MSTs. We note that the effectiveness of CLGrouping is inversely
related to the number of leaves in the MST. This motivates the problem of
finding a vertex-ranked MST with the minimum number of leaves (MLVRMST). We
provide a polynomial time algorithm for the MLVRMST problem, and prove its
correctness for graphs whose edges are weighted with tree-additive distances.
"
"  Variational Bayesian neural nets combine the flexibility of deep learning
with Bayesian uncertainty estimation. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff
between cheap but simple variational families (e.g.~fully factorized) or
expensive and complicated inference procedures. We show that natural gradient
ascent with adaptive weight noise implicitly fits a variational posterior to
maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO). This insight allows us to train
full-covariance, fully factorized, or matrix-variate Gaussian variational
posteriors using noisy versions of natural gradient, Adam, and K-FAC,
respectively, making it possible to scale up to modern-size ConvNets. On
standard regression benchmarks, our noisy K-FAC algorithm makes better
predictions and matches Hamiltonian Monte Carlo's predictive variances better
than existing methods. Its improved uncertainty estimates lead to more
efficient exploration in active learning, and intrinsic motivation for
reinforcement learning.
"
"  This paper analyzes the downlink performance of ultra-dense networks with
elevated base stations (BSs). We consider a general dual-slope pathloss model
with distance-dependent probability of line-of-sight (LOS) transmission between
BSs and receivers. Specifically, we consider the scenario where each link may
be obstructed by randomly placed buildings. Using tools from stochastic
geometry, we show that both coverage probability and area spectral efficiency
decay to zero as the BS density grows large. Interestingly, we show that the BS
height alone has a detrimental effect on the system performance even when the
standard single-slope pathloss model is adopted.
"
"  We demonstrate the first application of deep reinforcement learning to
autonomous driving. From randomly initialised parameters, our model is able to
learn a policy for lane following in a handful of training episodes using a
single monocular image as input. We provide a general and easy to obtain
reward: the distance travelled by the vehicle without the safety driver taking
control. We use a continuous, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm,
with all exploration and optimisation performed on-vehicle. This demonstrates a
new framework for autonomous driving which moves away from reliance on defined
logical rules, mapping, and direct supervision. We discuss the challenges and
opportunities to scale this approach to a broader range of autonomous driving
tasks.
"
"  Positioning data offer a remarkable source of information to analyze crowds
urban dynamics. However, discovering urban activity patterns from the emergent
behavior of crowds involves complex system modeling. An alternative approach is
to adopt computational techniques belonging to the emergent paradigm, which
enables self-organization of data and allows adaptive analysis. Specifically,
our approach is based on stigmergy. By using stigmergy each sample position is
associated with a digital pheromone deposit, which progressively evaporates and
aggregates with other deposits according to their spatiotemporal proximity.
Based on this principle, we exploit positioning data to identify high density
areas (hotspots) and characterize their activity over time. This
characterization allows the comparison of dynamics occurring in different days,
providing a similarity measure exploitable by clustering techniques. Thus, we
cluster days according to their activity behavior, discovering unexpected urban
activity patterns. As a case study, we analyze taxi traces in New York City
during 2015.
"
"  Improved Phantom cell is a new scenario which has been introduced recently to
enhance the capacity of Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). The main trait of
this scenario is that, besides maximizing the total network capacity in both
indoor and outdoor environments, it claims to reduce the handover number
compared to the conventional scenarios. In this paper, by a comprehensive
review of the Improved Phantom cells structure, an appropriate algorithm will
be introduced for the handover procedure of this scenario. To reduce the number
of handover in the proposed algorithm, various parameters such as the received
Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) at the user equipment (UE),
users access conditions to the phantom cells, and users staying time in the
target cell based on its velocity, has been considered. Theoretical analyses
and simulation results show that applying the suggested algorithm the improved
phantom cell structure has a much better performance than conventional HetNets
in terms of the number of handover.
"
"  We address the problem of localisation of objects as bounding boxes in images
with weak labels. This weakly supervised object localisation problem has been
tackled in the past using discriminative models where each object class is
localised independently from other classes. We propose a novel framework based
on Bayesian joint topic modelling. Our framework has three distinctive
advantages over previous works: (1) All object classes and image backgrounds
are modelled jointly together in a single generative model so that ""explaining
away"" inference can resolve ambiguity and lead to better learning and
localisation. (2) The Bayesian formulation of the model enables easy
integration of prior knowledge about object appearance to compensate for
limited supervision. (3) Our model can be learned with a mixture of weakly
labelled and unlabelled data, allowing the large volume of unlabelled images on
the Internet to be exploited for learning. Extensive experiments on the
challenging VOC dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art competitors.
"
"  Schoof's classic algorithm allows point-counting for elliptic curves over
finite fields in polynomial time. This algorithm was subsequently improved by
Atkin, using factorizations of modular polynomials, and by Elkies, using a
theory of explicit isogenies. Moving to Jacobians of genus-2 curves, the
current state of the art for point counting is a generalization of Schoof's
algorithm. While we are currently missing the tools we need to generalize
Elkies' methods to genus 2, recently Martindale and Milio have computed
analogues of modular polynomials for genus-2 curves whose Jacobians have real
multiplication by maximal orders of small discriminant. In this article, we
prove Atkin-style results for genus-2 Jacobians with real multiplication by
maximal orders, with a view to using these new modular polynomials to improve
the practicality of point-counting algorithms for these curves.

"  Transformative AI technologies have the potential to reshape critical aspects
of society in the near future. However, in order to properly prepare policy
initiatives for the arrival of such technologies accurate forecasts and
timelines are necessary. A survey was administered to attendees of three AI
conferences during the summer of 2018 (ICML, IJCAI and the HLAI conference).
The survey included questions for estimating AI capabilities over the next
decade, questions for forecasting five scenarios of transformative AI and
questions concerning the impact of computational resources in AI research.
Respondents indicated a median of 21.5% of human tasks (i.e., all tasks that
humans are currently paid to do) can be feasibly automated now, and that this
figure would rise to 40% in 5 years and 60% in 10 years. Median forecasts
indicated a 50% probability of AI systems being capable of automating 90% of
current human tasks in 25 years and 99% of current human tasks in 50 years. The
conference of attendance was found to have a statistically significant impact
on all forecasts, with attendees of HLAI providing more optimistic timelines
with less uncertainty. These findings suggest that AI experts expect major
advances in AI technology to continue over the next decade to a degree that
will likely have profound transformative impacts on society.

"  A matrix is said to possess the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) if it acts
as an approximate isometry when restricted to sparse vectors. Previous work has
shown it to be NP-hard to determine whether a matrix possess this property, but
only in a narrow range of parameters. In this work, we show that it is NP-hard
to make this determination for any accuracy parameter, even when we restrict
ourselves to instances which are either RIP or far from being RIP. This result
implies that it is NP-hard to approximate the range of parameters for which a
matrix possesses the Restricted Isometry Property with accuracy better than
some constant. Ours is the first work to prove such a claim without any
additional assumptions.

"  Time varying susceptibility of host at individual level due to waning and
boosting immunity is known to induce rich long-term behavior of disease
transmission dynamics. Meanwhile, the impact of the time varying heterogeneity
of host susceptibility on the shot-term behavior of epidemics is not
well-studied, even though the large amount of the available epidemiological
data are the short-term epidemics. Here we constructed a parsimonious
mathematical model describing the short-term transmission dynamics taking into
account natural-boosting immunity by reinfection, and obtained the explicit
solution for our model. We found that our system show ""the delayed epidemic"",
the epidemic takes off after negative slope of the epidemic curve at the
initial phase of epidemic, in addition to the common classification in the
standard SIR model, i.e., ""no epidemic"" as $\mathcal{R}_{0}\leq1$ or normal
epidemic as $\mathcal{R}_{0}>1$. Employing the explicit solution we derived the
condition for each classification.
"
"  The impact of random fluctuations on the dynamical behavior a complex
biological systems is a longstanding issue, whose understanding would shed
light on the evolutionary pressure that nature imposes on the intrinsic noise
levels and would allow rationally designing synthetic networks with controlled
noise. Using the Itō stochastic differential equation formalism, we performed
both analytic and numerical analyses of several model systems containing
different molecular species in contact with the environment and interacting
with each other through mass-action kinetics. These systems represent for
example biomolecular oligomerization processes, complex-breakage reactions,
signaling cascades or metabolic networks. For chemical reaction networks with
zero deficiency values, which admit a detailed- or complex-balanced steady
state, all molecular species are uncorrelated. The number of molecules of each
species follow a Poisson distribution and their Fano factors, which measure the
intrinsic noise, are equal to one. Systems with deficiency one have an
unbalanced non-equilibrium steady state and a non-zero S-flux, defined as the
flux flowing between the complexes multiplied by an adequate stoichiometric
coefficient. In this case, the noise on each species is reduced if the flux
flows from the species of lowest to highest complexity, and is amplified is the
flux goes in the opposite direction. These results are generalized to systems
of deficiency two, which possess two independent non-vanishing S-fluxes, and we
conjecture that a similar relation holds for higher deficiency systems.

"  Electronic health records (EHR) contain a large variety of information on the
clinical history of patients such as vital signs, demographics, diagnostic
codes and imaging data. The enormous potential for discovery in this rich
dataset is hampered by its complexity and heterogeneity.
We present the first study to assess unsupervised homogenization pipelines
designed for EHR clustering. To identify the optimal pipeline, we tested
accuracy on simulated data with varying amounts of redundancy, heterogeneity,
and missingness. We identified two optimal pipelines: 1) Multiple Imputation by
Chained Equations (MICE) combined with Local Linear Embedding; and 2) MICE,
Z-scoring, and Deep Autoencoders.

"  Investigating the emergence of a particular cell type is a recurring theme in
models of growing cellular populations. The evolution of resistance to therapy
is a classic example. Common questions are: when does the cell type first
occur, and via which sequence of steps is it most likely to emerge? For growing
populations, these questions can be formulated in a general framework of
branching processes spreading through a graph from a root to a target vertex.
Cells have a particular fitness value on each vertex and can transition along
edges at specific rates. Vertices represents cell states, say \mic{genotypes
}or physical locations, while possible transitions are acquiring a mutation or
cell migration. We focus on the setting where cells at the root vertex have the
highest fitness and transition rates are small. Simple formulas are derived for
the time to reach the target vertex and for the probability that it is reached
along a given path in the graph. We demonstrate our results on \mic{several
scenarios relevant to the emergence of drug resistance}, including: the
orderings of resistance-conferring mutations in bacteria and the impact of
imperfect drug penetration in cancer.

"  Gene regulatory networks are powerful abstractions of biological systems.
Since the advent of high-throughput measurement technologies in biology in the
late 90s, reconstructing the structure of such networks has been a central
computational problem in systems biology. While the problem is certainly not
solved in its entirety, considerable progress has been made in the last two
decades, with mature tools now available. This chapter aims to provide an
introduction to the basic concepts underpinning network inference tools,
attempting a categorisation which highlights commonalities and relative
strengths. While the chapter is meant to be self-contained, the material
presented should provide a useful background to the later, more specialised
chapters of this book.

"  We study a minimal model for the growth of a phenotypically heterogeneous
population of cells subject to a fluctuating environment in which they can
replicate (by exploiting available resources) and modify their phenotype within
a given landscape (thereby exploring novel configurations). The model displays
an exploration-exploitation trade-off whose specifics depend on the statistics
of the environment. Most notably, the phenotypic distribution corresponding to
maximum population fitness (i.e. growth rate) requires a non-zero exploration
rate when the magnitude of environmental fluctuations changes randomly over
time, while a purely exploitative strategy turns out to be optimal in two-state
environments, independently of the statistics of switching times. We obtain
analytical insight into the limiting cases of very fast and very slow
exploration rates by directly linking population growth to the features of the
environment.
"
"  Resolving the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has
been one of the central goals of modern ecology. Early debates about the
relationship were finally resolved with the advent of a statistical
partitioning scheme that decomposed the biodiversity effect into a ""selection""
effect and a ""complementarity"" effect. We prove that both the biodiversity
effect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are
fundamentally flawed because these methods use a naïve null expectation based
on neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity
effect, and they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem
functioning relationships observed in nature. Furthermore, under such
nonlinearity no statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity
effects. We also present an alternative metric providing a more reasonable
estimate of biodiversity effect. Our results suggest that all studies conducted
since the early 1990s likely overestimated the positive effects of biodiversity
on ecosystem functioning.
"
"  It has been shown recently that changing the fluidic properties of a drug can
improve its efficacy in ablating solid tumors. We develop a modeling framework
for tumor ablation, and present the simplest possible model for drug diffusion
in a spherical tumor with leaky boundaries and assuming cell death eventually
leads to ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities
numerically equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends
on both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to the
cell. Higher oxygen availability leads to cell death at lower drug
concentrations. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required for
a cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The
concentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which allows us
to compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can be plotted at
much finer time intervals compared to that of experiments, which is used to
produce a dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture
of the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the diffusion,
leak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is different for different
individuals and tumors, we produce artificial replication data through
bootstrapping to simulate error. While the usual data-driven model with
Sigmoidal curves use 12 free parameters, our mechanistic model only has two
free parameters, allowing it to be open to scrutiny rather than forcing
agreement with data. Even so, the simplest model in our framework, derived
here, shows close agreement with the bootstrapped curves, and reproduces well
established relations, such as Haber's rule.

"  We relate the concepts used in decentralized ledger technology to studies of
episodic memory in the mammalian brain. Specifically, we introduce the standard
concepts of linked list, hash functions, and sharding, from computer science.
We argue that these concepts may be more relevant to studies of the neural
mechanisms of memory than has been previously appreciated. In turn, we also
highlight that certain phenomena studied in the brain, namely metacognition,
reality monitoring, and how perceptual conscious experiences come about, may
inspire development in blockchain technology too, specifically regarding
probabilistic consensus protocols.

"  This study explores the validity of chain effects of clean water, which are
known as the ""Mills-Reincke phenomenon,"" in early twentieth-century Japan.
Recent studies have reported that water purifications systems are responsible
for huge contributions to human capital. Although a few studies have
investigated the short-term effects of water-supply systems in pre-war Japan,
little is known about the benefits associated with these systems. By analyzing
city-level cause-specific mortality data from the years 1922-1940, we found
that eliminating typhoid fever infections decreased the risk of deaths due to
non-waterborne diseases. Our estimates show that for one additional typhoid
death, there were approximately one to three deaths due to other causes, such
as tuberculosis and pneumonia. This suggests that the observed Mills-Reincke
phenomenon could have resulted from the prevention typhoid fever in a
previously-developing Asian country.

"  Inferring directional connectivity from point process data of multiple
elements is desired in various scientific fields such as neuroscience,
geography, economics, etc. Here, we propose an inference procedure for this
goal based on the kinetic Ising model. The procedure is composed of two steps:
(1) determination of the time-bin size for transforming the point-process data
to discrete time binary data and (2) screening of relevant couplings from the
estimated networks. For these, we develop simple methods based on information
theory and computational statistics. Applications to data from artificial and
\textit{in vitro} neuronal networks show that the proposed procedure performs
fairly well when identifying relevant couplings, including the discrimination
of their signs, with low computational cost. These results highlight the
potential utility of the kinetic Ising model to analyze real interacting
systems with event occurrences.

"  Development of a mesoscale neural circuitry map of the common marmoset is an
essential task due to the ideal characteristics of the marmoset as a model
organism for neuroscience research. To facilitate this development there is a
need for new computational tools to cross-register multi-modal data sets
containing MRI volumes as well as multiple histological series, and to register
the combined data set to a common reference atlas. We present a fully automatic
pipeline for same-subject-MRI guided reconstruction of image volumes from a
series of histological sections of different modalities, followed by
diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We show registration results for
Nissl, myelin, CTB, and fluorescent tracer images using a same-subject ex-vivo
MRI as our reference and show that our method achieves accurate registration
and eliminates artifactual warping that may be result from the absence of a
reference MRI data set. Examination of the determinant of the local metric
tensor of the diffeomorphic mapping between each subject's ex-vivo MRI and
resultant Nissl reconstruction allows an unprecedented local quantification of
geometrical distortions resulting from the histological processing, showing a
slight shrinkage, a median linear scale change of ~-1% in going from the
ex-vivo MRI to the tape-transfer generated histological image data.

"  When the brain receives input from multiple sensory systems, it is faced with
the question of whether it is appropriate to process the inputs in combination,
as if they originated from the same event, or separately, as if they originated
from distinct events. Furthermore, it must also have a mechanism through which
it can keep sensory inputs calibrated to maintain the accuracy of its internal
representations. We have developed a neural network architecture capable of i)
approximating optimal multisensory spatial integration, based on Bayesian
causal inference, and ii) recalibrating the spatial encoding of sensory
systems. The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing
hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and
the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons.
Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play
dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates
and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of
multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections
spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding
at the level of early unisensory cortices. Our proposed architecture provides
possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and
neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology
with behaviour.

"  A sequence of pathological changes takes place in Alzheimer's disease, which
can be assessed in vivo using various brain imaging methods. Currently, there
is no appropriate statistical model available that can easily integrate
multiple imaging modalities, being able to utilize the additional information
provided from the combined data. We applied Gaussian graphical models (GGMs)
for analyzing the conditional dependency networks of multimodal neuroimaging
data and assessed alterations of the network structure in mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) compared to cognitively healthy
controls.
Data from N=667 subjects were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative. Mean amyloid load (AV45-PET), glucose metabolism
(FDG-PET), and gray matter volume (MRI) was calculated for each brain region.
Separate GGMs were estimated using a Bayesian framework for the combined
multimodal data for each diagnostic category. Graph-theoretical statistics were
calculated to determine network alterations associated with disease severity.
Network measures clustering coefficient, path length and small-world
coefficient were significantly altered across diagnostic groups, with a
biphasic u-shape trajectory, i.e. increased small-world coefficient in early
MCI, intermediate values in late MCI, and decreased values in AD patients
compared to controls. In contrast, no group differences were found for
clustering coefficient and small-world coefficient when estimating conditional
dependency networks on single imaging modalities.
GGMs provide a useful methodology to analyze the conditional dependency
networks of multimodal neuroimaging data.

"  Identification of patients at high risk for readmission could help reduce
morbidity and mortality as well as healthcare costs. Most of the existing
studies on readmission prediction did not compare the contribution of data
categories. In this study we analyzed relative contribution of 90,101 variables
across 398,884 admission records corresponding to 163,468 patients, including
patient demographics, historical hospitalization information, discharge
disposition, diagnoses, procedures, medications and laboratory test results. We
established an interpretable readmission prediction model based on Logistic
Regression in scikit-learn, and added the available variables to the model one
by one in order to analyze the influences of individual data categories on
readmission prediction accuracy. Diagnosis related groups (c-statistic
increment of 0.0933) and discharge disposition (c-statistic increment of
0.0269) were the strongest contributors to model accuracy. Additionally, we
also identified the top ten contributing variables in every data category.

"  Non-conding RNAs play a key role in the post-transcriptional regulation of
mRNA translation and turnover in eukaryotes. miRNAs, in particular, interact
with their target RNAs through protein-mediated, sequence-specific binding,
giving rise to extended and highly heterogeneous miRNA-RNA interaction
networks. Within such networks, competition to bind miRNAs can generate an
effective positive coupling between their targets. Competing endogenous RNAs
(ceRNAs) can in turn regulate each other through miRNA-mediated crosstalk.
Albeit potentially weak, ceRNA interactions can occur both dynamically,
affecting e.g. the regulatory clock, and at stationarity, in which case ceRNA
networks as a whole can be implicated in the composition of the cell's
proteome. Many features of ceRNA interactions, including the conditions under
which they become significant, can be unraveled by mathematical and in silico
models. We review the understanding of the ceRNA effect obtained within such
frameworks, focusing on the methods employed to quantify it, its role in the
processing of gene expression noise, and how network topology can determine its
reach.

"  MicroRNAs play important roles in many biological processes. Their aberrant
expression can have oncogenic or tumor suppressor function directly
participating to carcinogenesis, malignant transformation, invasiveness and
metastasis. Indeed, miRNA profiles can distinguish not only between normal and
cancerous tissue but they can also successfully classify different subtypes of
a particular cancer. Here, we focus on a particular class of transcripts
encoding polycistronic miRNA genes that yields multiple miRNA components. We
describe clustered MiRNA Master Regulator Analysis (ClustMMRA), a fully
redesigned release of the MMRA computational pipeline (MiRNA Master Regulator
Analysis), developed to search for clustered miRNAs potentially driving cancer
molecular subtyping. Genomically clustered miRNAs are frequently co-expressed
to target different components of pro-tumorigenic signalling pathways. By
applying ClustMMRA to breast cancer patient data, we identified key miRNA
clusters driving the phenotype of different tumor subgroups. The pipeline was
applied to two independent breast cancer datasets, providing statistically
concordant results between the two analysis. We validated in cell lines the
miR-199/miR-214 as a novel cluster of miRNAs promoting the triple negative
subtype phenotype through its control of proliferation and EMT.

However, by giving direct access to cerebral blood flow maps, rs-fASL leads to

biomarker in common neuropathology. Our work here focuses on the link between
overall quality of rs-fASL and duration of acquisition. To this end, we
consider subject self-Default Mode Network (DMN), and assess DMN quality
depletion compared to a gold standard DMN depending on the duration of

"  Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mOxPhos) makes ATP, the energy
currency of life. Chemiosmosis, a proton centric mechanism, advocates that
Complex V harnesses a transmembrane potential (TMP) for ATP synthesis. This
perception of cellular respiration requires oxygen to stay tethered at Complex
IV (an association inhibited by cyanide) and diffusible reactive oxygen species
(DROS) are considered wasteful and toxic products. With new mechanistic
insights on heme and flavin enzymes, an oxygen or DROS centric explanation
(called murburn concept) was recently proposed for mOxPhos. In the new
mechanism, TMP is not directly harnessed, protons are a rate limiting reactant
and DROS within matrix serve as the chemical coupling agents that directly link
NADH oxidation with ATP synthesis. Herein, we report multiple ADP binding sites
and solvent accessible DROS channels in respiratory proteins, which validate
the oxygen or DROS centric power generation (ATP synthesis) system in mOxPhos.
Since cyanide's heme binding Kd is high (mM), low doses (uM) of cyanide is
lethal because cyanide disrupts DROS dynamics in mOxPhos. The critical study
also provides comprehensive arguments against Mitchell's and Boyer's
explanations and extensive support for murburn concept based holistic
perspectives for mOxPhos.

"  Computed tomography (CT) examinations are commonly used to predict lung
nodule malignancy in patients, which are shown to improve noninvasive early
diagnosis of lung cancer. It remains challenging for computational approaches
to achieve performance comparable to experienced radiologists. Here we present
NoduleX, a systematic approach to predict lung nodule malignancy from CT data,
based on deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN). For training and
validation, we analyze >1000 lung nodules in images from the LIDC/IDRI cohort.
All nodules were identified and classified by four experienced thoracic
radiologists who participated in the LIDC project. NoduleX achieves high
accuracy for nodule malignancy classification, with an AUC of ~0.99. This is
commensurate with the analysis of the dataset by experienced radiologists. Our
approach, NoduleX, provides an effective framework for highly accurate nodule
malignancy prediction with the model trained on a large patient population. Our
results are replicable with software available at

"  Correlated random walks (CRW) have been used for a long time as a null model
for animal's random search movement in two dimensions (2D). An increasing
number of studies focus on animals' movement in three dimensions (3D), but the
key properties of CRW, such as the way the mean squared displacement is related
to the path length, are well known only in 1D and 2D. In this paper I derive
such properties for 3D CRW, in a consistent way with the expression of these
properties in 2D. This should allow 3D CRW to act as a null model when
analyzing actual 3D movements similarly to what is done in 2D

"  Many real-world data sets, especially in biology, are produced by highly
multivariate and nonlinear complex dynamical systems. In this paper, we focus
on brain imaging data, including both calcium imaging and functional MRI data.
Standard vector-autoregressive models are limited by their linearity
assumptions, while nonlinear general-purpose, large-scale temporal models, such
as LSTM networks, typically require large amounts of training data, not always
readily available in biological applications; furthermore, such models have
limited interpretability. We introduce here a novel approach for learning a
nonlinear differential equation model aimed at capturing brain dynamics.
Specifically, we propose a variable-projection optimization approach to
estimate the parameters of the multivariate (coupled) van der Pol oscillator,
and demonstrate that such a model can accurately represent nonlinear dynamics
of the brain data. Furthermore, in order to improve the predictive accuracy
when forecasting future brain-activity time series, we use this analytical
model as an unlimited source of simulated data for pretraining LSTM; such
model-specific data augmentation approach consistently improves LSTM
performance on both calcium and fMRI imaging data.
"
"  The formation of pattern in biological systems may be modeled by a set of
reaction-diffusion equations. A diffusion-type coupling operator biologically
significant in neuroscience is a difference of Gaussian functions (Mexican Hat
operator) used as a spatial-convolution kernel. We are interested in the
difference among behaviors of \emph{stochastic} neural field equations, namely
space-time stochastic differential-integral equations, and similar
deterministic ones. We explore, quantitatively, how the parameters of our model
that measure the shape of the coupling kernel, coupling strength, and aspects
of the spatially-smoothed space-time noise, control the pattern in the
resulting evolving random field. We find that a spatial pattern that is damped
in time in a deterministic system may be sustained and amplified by
stochasticity, most strikingly at an optimal spatio-temporal noise level. In
addition, we find that spatially-smoothed noise alone causes pattern formation
even without spatial coupling.
"
"  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly thought to recognise
objects by learning increasingly complex representations of object shapes. Some
recent studies suggest a more important role of image textures. We here put
these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and
human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that
ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather
than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and
reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate
that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based
representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation
instead when trained on ""Stylized-ImageNet"", a stylized version of ImageNet.
This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our
well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560
psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of
unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and
previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions,
highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.
"
"  Our eyes sample a disproportionately large amount of information at the
centre of gaze with increasingly sparse sampling into the periphery. This
sampling scheme is widely believed to be a wiring constraint whereby high
resolution at the centre is achieved by sacrificing spatial acuity in the
periphery. Here we propose that this sampling scheme may be optimal for object
recognition because the relevant spatial content is dense near an object and
sparse in the surrounding vicinity. We tested this hypothesis by training deep
convolutional neural networks on full-resolution and foveated images. Our main
finding is that networks trained on images with foveated sampling show better
object classification compared to networks trained on full resolution images.
Importantly, blurring images according to the human blur function yielded the
best performance compared to images with shallower or steeper blurring. Taken
together our results suggest that, peripheral blurring in our eyes may have
evolved for optimal object recognition, rather than merely to satisfy wiring
constraints.
"
"  In the Ultimatum Game (UG) one player, named ""proposer"", has to decide how to
allocate a certain amount of money between herself and a ""responder"". If the
offer is greater than or equal to the responder's minimum acceptable offer
(MAO), then the money is split as proposed, otherwise, neither the proposer nor
the responder get anything. The UG has intrigued generations of behavioral
scientists because people in experiments blatantly violate the equilibrium
predictions that self-interested proposers offer the minimum available non-zero
amount, and self-interested responders accept. Why are these predictions
violated? Previous research has mainly focused on the role of social
preferences. Little is known about the role of general moral preferences for
doing the right thing, preferences that have been shown to play a major role in
other social interactions (e.g., Dictator Game and Prisoner's Dilemma). Here I
develop a theoretical model and an experiment designed to pit social
preferences against moral preferences. I find that, although people recognize
that offering half and rejecting low offers are the morally right things to do,
moral preferences have no causal impact on UG behavior. The experimental data
are indeed well fit by a model according to which: (i) high UG offers are
motivated by inequity aversion and, to a lesser extent, self-interest; (ii)
high MAOs are motivated by inequity aversion.

"  Open problems abound in the theory of complex networks, which has found
successful application to diverse fields of science. With the aim of further
advancing the understanding of the brain's functional connectivity, we propose
to evaluate a network metric which we term the geodesic entropy. This entropy,
in a way that can be made precise, quantifies the Shannon entropy of the
distance distribution to a specific node from all other nodes. Measurements of
geodesic entropy allow for the characterization of the structural information
of a network that takes into account the distinct role of each node into the
network topology. The measurement and characterization of this structural
information has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of sustained
activity and other emergent behaviors in networks, such as self-organized
criticality sometimes seen in such contexts. We apply these concepts and
methods to study the effects of how the psychedelic Ayahuasca affects the
functional connectivity of the human brain. We show that the geodesic entropy
is able to differentiate the functional networks of the human brain in two
different states of consciousness in the resting state: (i) the ordinary waking
state and (ii) a state altered by ingestion of the Ayahuasca. The entropy of
the nodes of brain networks from subjects under the influence of Ayahuasca
diverge significantly from those of the ordinary waking state. The functional
brain networks from subjects in the altered state have, on average, a larger
geodesic entropy compared to the ordinary state. We conclude that geodesic
entropy is a useful tool for analyzing complex networks and discuss how and why
it may bring even further valuable insights into the study of the human brain
and other empirical networks.

"  A quantitative understanding of how sensory signals are transformed into
motor outputs places useful constraints on brain function and helps reveal the
brain's underlying computations. We investigate how the nematode C. elegans
responds to time-varying mechanosensory signals using a high-throughput
optogenetic assay and automated behavior quantification. In the prevailing
picture of the touch circuit, the animal's behavior is determined by which
neurons are stimulated and by the stimulus amplitude. In contrast, we find that
the behavioral response is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory
signals, like its integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds.
Mechanosensory signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit
different behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response
also depends on its behavioral context. Most dramatically, the animal ignores
all tested mechanosensory stimuli during turns. Finally, we present a
linear-nonlinear model that predicts the animal's behavioral response to
stimulus.

"  Noise is an inherent part of neuronal dynamics, and thus of the brain. It can
be observed in neuronal activity at different spatiotemporal scales, including
in neuronal membrane potentials, local field potentials,
electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography. A central research topic in
contemporary neuroscience is to elucidate the functional role of noise in
neuronal information processing. Experimental studies have shown that a
suitable level of noise may enhance the detection of weak neuronal signals by
means of stochastic resonance. In response, theoretical research, based on the
theory of stochastic processes, nonlinear dynamics, and statistical physics,
has made great strides in elucidating the mechanism and the many benefits of
stochastic resonance in neuronal systems. In this perspective, we review recent
research dedicated to neuronal stochastic resonance in biophysical mathematical
models. We also explore the regulation of neuronal stochastic resonance, and we
outline important open questions and directions for future research. A deeper
understanding of neuronal stochastic resonance may afford us new insights into
the highly impressive information processing in the brain.

"  The Partial Information Decomposition (PID) [arXiv:1004.2515] provides a
theoretical framework to characterize and quantify the structure of
multivariate information sharing. A new method (Idep) has recently been
proposed for computing a two-predictor PID over discrete spaces.
[arXiv:1709.06653] A lattice of maximum entropy probability models is
constructed based on marginal dependency constraints, and the unique
information that a particular predictor has about the target is defined as the
minimum increase in joint predictor-target mutual information when that
particular predictor-target marginal dependency is constrained. Here, we apply
the Idep approach to Gaussian systems, for which the marginally constrained
maximum entropy models are Gaussian graphical models. Closed form solutions for
the Idep PID are derived for both univariate and multivariate Gaussian systems.
Numerical and graphical illustrations are provided, together with practical and
theoretical comparisons of the Idep PID with the minimum mutual information PID
(Immi). [arXiv:1411.2832] In particular, it is proved that the Immi method
generally produces larger estimates of redundancy and synergy than does the
Idep method. In discussion of the practical examples, the PIDs are complemented
by the use of deviance tests for the comparison of Gaussian graphical models.

"  Understanding the origin, nature, and functional significance of complex
patterns of neural activity, as recorded by diverse electrophysiological and
neuroimaging techniques, is a central challenge in neuroscience. Such patterns
include collective oscillations emerging out of neural synchronization as well
as highly heterogeneous outbursts of activity interspersed by periods of
quiescence, called ""neuronal avalanches."" Much debate has been generated about
the possible scale invariance or criticality of such avalanches and its
relevance for brain function. Aimed at shedding light onto this, here we
analyze the large-scale collective properties of the cortex by using a
mesoscopic approach following the principle of parsimony of Landau-Ginzburg.
Our model is similar to that of Wilson-Cowan for neural dynamics but crucially,
includes stochasticity and space; synaptic plasticity and inhibition are
considered as possible regulatory mechanisms. Detailed analyses uncover a phase
diagram including down-state, synchronous, asynchronous, and up-state phases
and reveal that empirical findings for neuronal avalanches are consistently
reproduced by tuning our model to the edge of synchronization. This reveals
that the putative criticality of cortical dynamics does not correspond to a
quiescent-to-active phase transition as usually assumed in theoretical
approaches but to a synchronization phase transition, at which incipient
oscillations and scale-free avalanches coexist. Furthermore, our model also
accounts for up and down states as they occur (e.g., during deep sleep). This
approach constitutes a framework to rationalize the possible collective phases
and phase transitions of cortical networks in simple terms, thus helping to
shed light on basic aspects of brain functioning from a very broad perspective.

"  Reconstruction of population histories is a central problem in population
genetics. Existing coalescent-based methods, like the seminal work of Li and
Durbin (Nature, 2011), attempt to solve this problem using sequence data but
have no rigorous guarantees. Determining the amount of data needed to correctly
reconstruct population histories is a major challenge. Using a variety of tools
from information theory, the theory of extremal polynomials, and approximation
theory, we prove new sharp information-theoretic lower bounds on the problem of
reconstructing population structure -- the history of multiple subpopulations
that merge, split and change sizes over time. Our lower bounds are exponential
in the number of subpopulations, even when reconstructing recent histories. We
demonstrate the sharpness of our lower bounds by providing algorithms for
distinguishing and learning population histories with matching dependence on
the number of subpopulations.

"  Recent machine learning models have shown that including attention as a
component results in improved model accuracy and interpretability, despite the
concept of attention in these approaches only loosely approximating the brain's
attention mechanism. Here we extend this work by building a more brain-inspired
deep network model of the primate ATTention Network (ATTNet) that learns to
shift its attention so as to maximize the reward. Using deep reinforcement
learning, ATTNet learned to shift its attention to the visual features of a
target category in the context of a search task. ATTNet's dorsal layers also
learned to prioritize these shifts of attention so as to maximize success of
the ventral pathway classification and receive greater reward. Model behavior
was tested against the fixations made by subjects searching images for the same
cued category. Both subjects and ATTNet showed evidence for attention being
preferentially directed to target goals, behaviorally measured as oculomotor
guidance to targets. More fundamentally, ATTNet learned to shift its attention
to target like objects and spatially route its visual inputs to accomplish the
task. This work makes a step toward a better understanding of the role of
attention in the brain and other computational systems.

"  Vision science, particularly machine vision, has been revolutionized by
introducing large-scale image datasets and statistical learning approaches.
Yet, human neuroimaging studies of visual perception still rely on small
numbers of images (around 100) due to time-constrained experimental procedures.
To apply statistical learning approaches that integrate neuroscience, the
number of images used in neuroimaging must be significantly increased. We
present BOLD5000, a human functional MRI (fMRI) study that includes almost
5,000 distinct images depicting real-world scenes. Beyond dramatically
increasing image dataset size relative to prior fMRI studies, BOLD5000 also
accounts for image diversity, overlapping with standard computer vision
datasets by incorporating images from the Scene UNderstanding (SUN), Common
Objects in Context (COCO), and ImageNet datasets. The scale and diversity of
these image datasets, combined with a slow event-related fMRI design, enable
fine-grained exploration into the neural representation of a wide range of
visual features, categories, and semantics. Concurrently, BOLD5000 brings us
closer to realizing Marr's dream of a singular vision science - the intertwined
study of biological and computer vision.

"  In spite of decades of research, much remains to be discovered about folding:
the detailed structure of the initial (unfolded) state, vestigial folding
instructions remaining only in the unfolded state, the interaction of the
molecule with the solvent, instantaneous power at each point within the
molecule during folding, the fact that the process is stable in spite of myriad
possible disturbances, potential stabilization of trajectory by chaos, and, of
course, the exact physical mechanism (code or instructions) by which the
folding process is specified in the amino acid sequence. Simulations based upon
microscopic physics have had some spectacular successes and continue to
improve, particularly as super-computer capabilities increase. The simulations,
exciting as they are, are still too slow and expensive to deal with the
enormous number of molecules of interest. In this paper, we introduce an
approximate model based upon physics, empirics, and information science which
is proposed for use in machine learning applications in which very large
numbers of sub-simulations must be made. In particular, we focus upon machine
learning applications in the learning phase and argue that our model is
sufficiently close to the physics that, in spite of its approximate nature, can
facilitate stepping through machine learning solutions to explore the mechanics
of folding mentioned above. We particularly emphasize the exploration of energy
flow (power) within the molecule during folding, the possibility of energy
scale invariance (above a threshold), vestigial information in the unfolded
state as attractive targets for such machine language analysis, and statistical
analysis of an ensemble of folding micro-steps.

"  Finding actions that satisfy the constraints imposed by both external inputs
and internal representations is central to decision making. We demonstrate that
some important classes of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can be solved
by networks composed of homogeneous cooperative-competitive modules that have
connectivity similar to motifs observed in the superficial layers of neocortex.
The winner-take-all modules are sparsely coupled by programming neurons that
embed the constraints onto the otherwise homogeneous modular computational
substrate. We show rules that embed any instance of the CSPs planar four-color
graph coloring, maximum independent set, and Sudoku on this substrate, and
provide mathematical proofs that guarantee these graph coloring problems will
convergence to a solution. The network is composed of non-saturating linear
threshold neurons. Their lack of right saturation allows the overall network to
explore the problem space driven through the unstable dynamics generated by
recurrent excitation. The direction of exploration is steered by the constraint
neurons. While many problems can be solved using only linear inhibitory
constraints, network performance on hard problems benefits significantly when
these negative constraints are implemented by non-linear multiplicative
inhibition. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of instability
rather than stability in network computation, and also offer insight into the
computational role of dual inhibitory mechanisms in neural circuits.

"  In this study, we developed a method to estimate the relationship between
stimulation current and volatility during isometric contraction. In functional
electrical stimulation (FES), joints are driven by applying voltage to muscles.
This technology has been used for a long time in the field of rehabilitation,
and recently application oriented research has been reported. However,
estimation of the relationship between stimulus value and exercise capacity has
not been discussed to a great extent. Therefore, in this study, a human muscle
model was estimated using the transfer function estimation method with fast
Fourier transform. It was found that the relationship between stimulation
current and force exerted could be expressed by a first-order lag system. In
verification of the force estimate, the ability of the proposed model to
estimate the exerted force under steady state response was found to be good.

and biophysical transitions, and it provides a fully analytic description of
the processes. Our approach is explained for the case of a single protein
searching for a specific binding site on DNA. In addition, the application of
the method to investigations of the effect of DNA sequence heterogeneity, and
the role multiple targets and traps in the protein search dynamics are

"  From philosophers of ancient times to modern economists, biologists and other
researchers are engaged in revealing causal relations. The most challenging
problem is inferring the type of the causal relationship: whether it is uni- or
bi-directional or only apparent - implied by a hidden common cause only. Modern
technology provides us tools to record data from complex systems such as the
ecosystem of our planet or the human brain, but understanding their functioning
needs detection and distinction of causal relationships of the system
components without interventions. Here we present a new method, which
distinguishes and assigns probabilities to the presence of all the possible
causal relations between two or more time series from dynamical systems. The
new method is validated on synthetic datasets and applied to EEG
(electroencephalographic) data recorded in epileptic patients. Given the
universality of our method, it may find application in many fields of science.

"  The thermoregulation system in animals removes body heat in hot temperatures
and retains body heat in cold temperatures. The better the animal removes heat,
the worse the animal retains heat and visa versa. It is the balance between

amount of hair. The rat's loss of tail hair and human's loss of its body hair

"  Molecular interactions have widely been modelled as networks. The local
wiring patterns around molecules in molecular networks are linked with their
biological functions. However, networks model only pairwise interactions
between molecules and cannot explicitly and directly capture the higher order
molecular organisation, such as protein complexes and pathways. Hence, we ask
if hypergraphs (hypernetworks), that directly capture entire complexes and
pathways along with protein-protein interactions (PPIs), carry additional
functional information beyond what can be uncovered from networks of pairwise
molecular interactions. The mathematical formalism of a hypergraph has long
been known, but not often used in studying molecular networks due to the lack
of sophisticated algorithms for mining the underlying biological information
hidden in the wiring patterns of molecular systems modelled as hypernetworks.
We propose a new, multi-scale, protein interaction hypernetwork model that
utilizes hypergraphs to capture different scales of protein organization,
including PPIs, protein complexes and pathways. In analogy to graphlets, we
introduce hypergraphlets, small, connected, non-isomorphic, induced
sub-hypergraphs of a hypergraph, to quantify the local wiring patterns of these
multi-scale molecular hypergraphs and to mine them for new biological
information. We apply them to model the multi-scale protein networks of baker
yeast and human and show that the higher order molecular organisation captured
by these hypergraphs is strongly related to the underlying biology.
Importantly, we demonstrate that our new models and data mining tools reveal
different, but complementary biological information compared to classical PPI
networks. We apply our hypergraphlets to successfully predict biological
functions of uncharacterised proteins.

"  Amyloid precursor with 770 amino acids dimerizes and aggregates, as do its c
terminal 99 amino acids and amyloid 40,42 amino acids fragments. The titled
question has been discussed extensively, and here it is addressed further using
thermodynamic scaling theory to analyze mutational trends in structural factors
and kinetics. Special attention is given to Family Alzheimer's Disease
mutations outside amyloid 42. The scaling analysis is connected to extensive
docking simulations which included membranes, thereby confirming their results
and extending them to Amyloid precursor.

"  The paper is concerned with an in-body system gathering data for medical
purposes. It is focused on communication between the following two components
of the system: liposomes gathering the data inside human veins and a detector
collecting the data from liposomes. Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
is considered as a mechanism for communication between the system components.
The usage of bioluminescent molecules as an energy source for generating FRET
signals is suggested and the performance evaluation of this approach is given.
FRET transmission may be initiated without an aid of an external laser, which
is crucial in case of communication taking place inside of human body. It is
also shown how to solve the problem of FRET signals recording. The usage of
channelrhodopsin molecules, able to receive FRET signals and convert them into
voltage, is proposed. The communication system is modelled with molecular
structures and spectral characteristics of the proposed molecules and further
validated by using Monte Carlo computer simulations, calculating the data
throughput and the bit error rate.

"  Modelling gene regulatory networks not only requires a thorough understanding
of the biological system depicted but also the ability to accurately represent
this system from a mathematical perspective. Throughout this chapter, we aim to
familiarise the reader with the biological processes and molecular factors at
play in the process of gene expression regulation.We first describe the
different interactions controlling each step of the expression process, from
transcription to mRNA and protein decay. In the second section, we provide
statistical tools to accurately represent this biological complexity in the
form of mathematical models. Amongst other considerations, we discuss the
topological properties of biological networks, the application of deterministic
and stochastic frameworks and the quantitative modelling of regulation. We
particularly focus on the use of such models for the simulation of expression
data that can serve as a benchmark for the testing of network inference
algorithms.

"  The central aim in this paper is to address variable selection questions in
nonlinear and nonparametric regression. Motivated by statistical genetics,
where nonlinear interactions are of particular interest, we introduce a novel
and interpretable way to summarize the relative importance of predictor
variables. Methodologically, we develop the ""RelATive cEntrality"" (RATE)
measure to prioritize candidate genetic variants that are not just marginally
important, but whose associations also stem from significant covarying
relationships with other variants in the data. We illustrate RATE through
Bayesian Gaussian process regression, but the methodological innovations apply
to other ""black box"" methods. It is known that nonlinear models often exhibit
greater predictive accuracy than linear models, particularly for phenotypes
generated by complex genetic architectures. With detailed simulations and two
real data association mapping studies, we show that applying RATE enables an
explanation for this improved performance.

"  Assessment of the motor activity of group-housed sows in commercial farms.
The objective of this study was to specify the level of motor activity of
pregnant sows housed in groups in different housing systems. Eleven commercial
farms were selected for this study. Four housing systems were represented:
small groups of five to seven sows (SG), free access stalls (FS) with exercise
area, electronic sow feeder with a stable group (ESFsta) or a dynamic group
(ESFdyn). Ten sows in mid-gestation were observed in each farm. The
observations of motor activity were made for 6 hours at the first meal or at
the start of the feeding sequence, two consecutive days and at regular
intervals of 4 minutes. The results show that the motor activity of
group-housed sows depends on the housing system. The activity is higher with
the ESFdyn system (standing: 55.7%), sows are less active in the SG system
(standing: 26.5%), and FS system is intermediate. The distance traveled by sows
in ESF system is linked to a larger area available. Thus, sows travel an
average of 362 m $\pm$ 167 m in the ESFdyn system with an average available
surface of 446 m${}^2$ whereas sows in small groups travel 50 m $\pm$ 15 m for
15 m${}^2$ available.

"  Phylogenetic networks are becoming of increasing interest to evolutionary
biologists due to their ability to capture complex non-treelike evolutionary
processes. From a combinatorial point of view, such networks are certain types
of rooted directed acyclic graphs whose leaves are labelled by, for example,
species. A number of mathematically interesting classes of phylogenetic
networks are known. These include the biologically relevant class of stable
phylogenetic networks whose members are defined via certain fold-up and un-fold
operations that link them with concepts arising within the theory of, for
example, graph fibrations. Despite this exciting link, the structural
complexity of stable phylogenetic networks is still relatively poorly
understood. Employing the popular tree-based, reticulation-visible, and
tree-child properties which allow one to gauge this complexity in one way or
another, we provide novel characterizations for when a stable phylogenetic
network satisfies either one of these three properties.
"
"  In view of recent intense experimental and theoretical interests in the
biophysics of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs), heteropolymer models with chain molecules configured as
self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice are constructed to study how
phase behaviors depend on the sequence of monomers along the chains. To address
pertinent general principles, we focus primarily on two fully charged
50-monomer sequences with significantly different charge patterns. Each monomer
in our models occupies a single lattice site and all monomers interact via a
screened pairwise Coulomb potential. Phase diagrams are obtained by extensive
Monte Carlo sampling performed at multiple temperatures on ensembles of 300
chains in boxes of sizes ranging from $52\times 52\times 52$ to $246\times
246\times 246$ to simulate a large number of different systems with the overall
polymer volume fraction $\phi$ in each system varying from $0.001$ to $0.1$.
Phase separation in the model systems is characterized by the emergence of a
large cluster connected by inter-monomer nearest-neighbor lattice contacts and
by large fluctuations in local polymer density. The simulated critical
temperatures, $T_{\rm cr}$, of phase separation for the two sequences differ
significantly, whereby the sequence with a more ""blocky"" charge pattern
exhibits a substantially higher propensity to phase separate. The trend is
consistent with our sequence-specific random-phase-approximation (RPA) polymer
theory, but the variation of the simulated $T_{\rm cr}$ with a previously
proposed ""sequence charge decoration"" pattern parameter is milder than that
predicted by RPA. Ramifications of our findings for the development of
analytical theory and simulation protocols of IDP LLPS are discussed.

"  The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the best characterized
eukaryotic models. The secretory pathway was the first trafficking pathway
clearly understood mainly thanks to the work done in the laboratory of Randy
Schekman in the 1980s. They have isolated yeast sec mutants unable to secrete
an extracellular enzyme and these SEC genes were identified as encoding key
effectors of the secretory machinery. For this work, the 2013 Nobel Prize in
Physiology and Medicine has been awarded to Randy Schekman; the prize is shared
with James Rothman and Thomas S{ü}dhof. Here, we present the different
trafficking pathways of yeast S. cerevisiae. At the Golgi apparatus newly
synthesized proteins are sorted between those transported to the plasma
membrane (PM), or the external medium, via the exocytosis or secretory pathway
(SEC), and those targeted to the vacuole either through endosomes (vacuolar
protein sorting or VPS pathway) or directly (alkaline phosphatase or ALP
pathway). Plasma membrane proteins can be internalized by endocytosis (END) and
transported to endosomes where they are sorted between those targeted for
vacuolar degradation and those redirected to the Golgi (recycling or RCY
pathway). Studies in yeast S. cerevisiae allowed the identification of most of
the known effectors, protein complexes, and trafficking pathways in eukaryotic
cells, and most of them are conserved among eukaryotes.

"  {\it Ellsberg thought experiments} and empirical confirmation of Ellsberg
preferences pose serious challenges to {\it subjective expected utility theory}
(SEUT). We have recently elaborated a quantum-theoretic framework for human
decisions under uncertainty which satisfactorily copes with the Ellsberg
paradox and other puzzles of SEUT. We apply here the quantum-theoretic
framework to the {\it Ellsberg two-urn example}, showing that the paradox can
be explained by assuming a state change of the conceptual entity that is the
object of the decision ({\it decision-making}, or {\it DM}, {\it entity}) and
representing subjective probabilities by quantum probabilities. We also model
the empirical data we collected in a DM test on human participants within the
theoretic framework above. The obtained results are relevant, as they provide a
line to model real life, e.g., financial and medical, decisions that show the
same empirical patterns as the two-urn experiment.
"
"  Recent large cancer studies have measured somatic alterations in an
unprecedented number of tumours. These large datasets allow the identification
of cancer-related sets of genetic alterations by identifying relevant
combinatorial patterns. Among such patterns, mutual exclusivity has been
employed by several recent methods that have shown its effectivenes in
characterizing gene sets associated to cancer. Mutual exclusivity arises
because of the complementarity, at the functional level, of alterations in
genes which are part of a group (e.g., a pathway) performing a given function.
The availability of quantitative target profiles, from genetic perturbations or
from clinical phenotypes, provides additional information that can be leveraged
to improve the identification of cancer related gene sets by discovering groups
with complementary functional associations with such targets.
In this work we study the problem of finding groups of mutually exclusive
alterations associated with a quantitative (functional) target. We propose a
combinatorial formulation for the problem, and prove that the associated
computation problem is computationally hard. We design two algorithms to solve
the problem and implement them in our tool UNCOVER. We provide analytic
evidence of the effectiveness of UNCOVER in finding high-quality solutions and
show experimentally that UNCOVER finds sets of alterations significantly
associated with functional targets in a variety of scenarios. In addition, our
algorithms are much faster than the state-of-the-art, allowing the analysis of
large datasets of thousands of target profiles from cancer cell lines. We show
that on one such dataset from project Achilles our methods identify several
significant gene sets with complementary functional associations with targets.

"  Biological networks are a very convenient modelling and visualisation tool to
discover knowledge from modern high-throughput genomics and postgenomics data
sets. Indeed, biological entities are not isolated, but are components of
complex multi-level systems. We go one step further and advocate for the
consideration of causal representations of the interactions in living
systems.We present the causal formalism and bring it out in the context of
biological networks, when the data is observational. We also discuss its
ability to decipher the causal information flow as observed in gene expression.
We also illustrate our exploration by experiments on small simulated networks
as well as on a real biological data set.

"  A number of microorganisms leave persistent trails while moving along
surfaces. For single-cell organisms, the trail-mediated self-interaction will
influence its dynamics. It has been discussed recently [Kranz \textit{et al.}
Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{117}, 8101 (2016)] that the self-interaction may
localize the organism above a critical coupling $\chi_c$ to the trail. Here we
will derive a generalized active particle model capturing the key features of
the self-interaction and analyze its behavior for smaller couplings $\chi <
\chi_c$. We find that fluctuations in propulsion speed shift the localization
transition to stronger couplings.
"
"  Several dihedral angles prediction methods were developed for protein
structure prediction and their other applications. However, distribution of
predicted angles would not be similar to that of real angles. To address this
we employed generative adversarial networks (GAN). Generative adversarial
networks are composed of two adversarially trained networks: a discriminator
and a generator. A discriminator distinguishes samples from a dataset and
generated samples while a generator generates realistic samples. Although the
discriminator of GANs is trained to estimate density, GAN model is intractable.
On the other hand, noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) was introduced to
estimate a normalization constant of an unnormalized statistical model and thus
the density function. In this thesis, we introduce noise-contrastive estimation
generative adversarial networks (NCE-GAN) which enables explicit density
estimation of a GAN model. And a new loss for the generator is proposed. We
also propose residue-wise variants of auxiliary classifier GAN (AC-GAN) and
Semi-supervised GAN to handle sequence information in a window. In our
experiment, the conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), AC-GAN and
Semi-supervised GAN were compared. And experiments done with improved
conditions were invested. We identified a phenomenon of AC-GAN that
distribution of its predicted angles is composed of unusual clusters. The
distribution of the predicted angles of Semi-supervised GAN was most similar to
the Ramachandran plot. We found that adding the output of the NCE as an
additional input of the discriminator is helpful to stabilize the training of
the GANs and to capture the detailed structures. Adding regression loss and
using predicted angles by regression loss only model could improve the
conditional generation performance of the C-GAN and AC-GAN.
"
"  Traveling fronts describe the transition between two alternative states in a
great number of physical and biological systems. Examples include the spread of
beneficial mutations, chemical reactions, and the invasions by foreign species.
In homogeneous environments, the alternative states are separated by a smooth
front moving at a constant velocity. This simple picture can break down in
structured environments such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic
devices. Habitat fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or
lock invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not
sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined by the
spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The synchronization with
the environment results in discontinuous fronts that propagate as periodic
pulses. We characterize the transition from continuous to locked invasions and
show that it is controlled by positive density-dependence in dispersal or
growth. We also demonstrate that velocity locking is robust to demographic and
environmental fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in
locked invasions.

"  We show that the expected size of the maximum agreement subtree of two
$n$-leaf trees, uniformly random among all trees with the shape, is
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$. To derive the lower bound, we prove a global structural
result on a decomposition of rooted binary trees into subgroups of leaves
called blobs. To obtain the upper bound, we generalize a first moment argument
for random tree distributions that are exchangeable and not necessarily
sampling consistent.
"
"  Neurofeedback is a form of brain training in which subjects are fed back
information about some measure of their brain activity which they are
instructed to modify in a way thought to be functionally advantageous. Over the
last twenty years, NF has been used to treat various neurological and
psychiatric conditions, and to improve cognitive function in various contexts.
However, despite its growing popularity, each of the main steps in NF comes
with its own set of often covert assumptions. Here we critically examine some
conceptual and methodological issues associated with the way general objectives
and neural targets of NF are defined, and review the neural mechanisms through
which NF may act, and the way its efficacy is gauged. The NF process is
characterised in terms of functional dynamics, and possible ways in which it
may be controlled are discussed. Finally, it is proposed that improving NF will
require better understanding of various fundamental aspects of brain dynamics
and a more precise definition of functional brain activity and brain-behaviour
relationships.
"
"  This work focuses on the question of how identifiability of a mathematical
model, that is, whether parameters can be recovered from data, is related to
identifiability of its submodels. We look specifically at linear compartmental
models and investigate when identifiability is preserved after adding or
removing model components. In particular, we examine whether identifiability is
preserved when an input, output, edge, or leak is added or deleted. Our
approach, via differential algebra, is to analyze specific input-output
equations of a model and the Jacobian of the associated coefficient map. We
clarify a prior determinantal formula for these equations, and then use it to
prove that, under some hypotheses, a model's input-output equations can be
understood in terms of certain submodels we call ""output-reachable"". Our proofs
use algebraic and combinatorial techniques.

"  Plasmids are autonomously replicating genetic elements in bacteria. At cell
division plasmids are distributed among the two daughter cells. This gene
transfer from one generation to the next is called vertical gene transfer. We
study the dynamics of a bacterial population carrying plasmids and are in
particular interested in the long-time distribution of plasmids. Starting with
a model for a bacterial population structured by the discrete number of
plasmids, we proceed to the continuum limit in order to derive a continuous
model. The model incorporates plasmid reproduction, division and death of
bacteria, and distribution of plasmids at cell division. It is a hyperbolic
integro-differential equation and a so-called growth-fragmentation-death model.
As we are interested in the long-time distribution of plasmids we study the
associated eigenproblem and show existence of eigensolutions. The stability of
this solution is studied by analyzing the spectrum of the integro-differential
operator given by the eigenproblem. By relating the spectrum with the spectrum
of an integral operator we find a simple real dominating eigenvalue with a
non-negative corresponding eigenfunction. Moreover, we describe an iterative
method for the numerical construction of the eigenfunction.
"
"  With recent developments in remote sensing technologies, plot-level forest
resources can be predicted utilizing airborne laser scanning (ALS). The
prediction is often assisted by mostly vertical summaries of the ALS point
clouds. We present a spatial analysis of the point cloud by studying the
horizontal distribution of the pulse returns through canopy height models
thresholded at different height levels. The resulting patterns of patches of
vegetation and gabs on each layer are summarized to spatial ALS features. We
propose new features based on the Euler number, which is the number of patches
minus the number of gaps, and the empty-space function, which is a spatial
summary function of the gab space. The empty-space function is also used to
describe differences in the gab structure between two different layers. We
illustrate usefulness of the proposed spatial features for predicting different
forest variables that summarize the spatial structure of forests or their
breast height diameter distribution. We employ the proposed spatial features,
in addition to commonly used features from literature, in the well-known k-nn
estimation method to predict the forest variables. We present the methodology
on the example of a study site in Central Finland.
"
"  Metabolic fluxes in cells are governed by physical, biochemical,
physiological, and economic principles. Cells may show ""economical"" behaviour,
trading metabolic performance against the costly side-effects of high enzyme or
metabolite concentrations. Some constraint-based flux prediction methods score
fluxes by heuristic flux costs as proxies of enzyme investments. However,
linear cost functions ignore enzyme kinetics and the tight coupling between
fluxes, metabolite levels and enzyme levels. To derive more realistic cost
functions, I define an apparent ""enzymatic flux cost"" as the minimal enzyme
cost at which the fluxes can be realised in a given kinetic model, and a
""kinetic flux cost"", which includes metabolite cost. I discuss the mathematical
properties of such flux cost functions, their usage for flux prediction, and
their importance for cells' metabolic strategies. The enzymatic flux cost
scales linearly with the fluxes and is a concave function on the flux polytope.
The costs of two flows are usually not additive, due to an additional
""compromise cost"". Between flux polytopes, where fluxes change their
directions, the enzymatic cost shows a jump. With strictly concave flux cost
functions, cells can reduce their enzymatic cost by running different fluxes in
different cell compartments or at different moments in time. The enzymactic
flux cost can be translated into an approximated cell growth rate, a convex
function on the flux polytope. Growth-maximising metabolic states can be
predicted by Flux Cost Minimisation (FCM), a variant of FBA based on general
flux cost functions. The solutions are flux distributions in corners of the
flux polytope, i.e. typically elementary flux modes. Enzymatic flux costs can
be linearly or nonlinearly approximated, providing model parameters for linear
FBA based on kinetic parameters and extracellular concentrations, and justified
by a kinetic model.
"
"  The brain can display self-sustained activity (SSA), which is the persistent
firing of neurons in the absence of external stimuli. This spontaneous activity
shows low neuronal firing rates and is observed in diverse in vitro and in vivo
situations. In this work, we study the influence of excitatory/inhibitory
balance, connection density, and network size on the self-sustained activity of
a neuronal network model. We build a random network of adaptive exponential
integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neuron models connected through inhibitory and
excitatory chemical synapses. The AdEx model mimics several behaviours of
biological neurons, such as spike initiation, adaptation, and bursting
patterns. In an excitation/inhibition balanced state, if the mean connection
degree (K) is fixed, the firing rate does not depend on the network size (N),
whereas for fixed N, the firing rate decreases when K increases. However, for
large K, SSA states can appear only for large N. We show the existence of SSA
states with similar behaviours to those observed in experimental recordings,
such as very low and irregular neuronal firing rates, and spike-train power
spectra with slow fluctuations, only for balanced networks of large size.
"
"  This paper studies the dynamics of a network-based SIRS epidemic model with
vaccination and a nonmonotone incidence rate. This type of nonlinear incidence
can be used to describe the psychological or inhibitory effect from the
behavioral change of the susceptible individuals when the number of infective
individuals on heterogeneous networks is getting larger. Using the analytical
method, epidemic threshold $R_0$ is obtained. When $R_0$ is less than one, we
prove the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the
disease dies out, while $R_0$ is greater than one, there exists a unique
endemic equilibrium. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, we also
prove the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if the
inhibitory factor $\alpha$ is sufficiently large. Numerical experiments are
also given to support the theoretical results. It is shown both theoretically
and numerically a larger $\alpha$ can accelerate the extinction of the disease
and reduce the level of disease.
"
"  Mathematical modelers have long known of a ""rule of thumb"" referred to as the
Linear Chain Trick (LCT; aka the Gamma Chain Trick): a technique used to
construct mean field ODE models from continuous-time stochastic state
transition models where the time an individual spends in a given state (i.e.,
the dwell time) is Erlang distributed (i.e., gamma distributed with integer
shape parameter). Despite the LCT's widespread use, we lack general theory to
facilitate the easy application of this technique, especially for complex
models. This has forced modelers to choose between constructing ODE models
using heuristics with oversimplified dwell time assumptions, using time
consuming derivations from first principles, or to instead use non-ODE models
(like integro-differential equations or delay differential equations) which can
be cumbersome to derive and analyze. Here, we provide analytical results that
enable modelers to more efficiently construct ODE models using the LCT or
related extensions. Specifically, we 1) provide novel extensions of the LCT to
various scenarios found in applications; 2) provide formulations of the LCT and
it's extensions that bypass the need to derive ODEs from integral or stochastic
model equations; and 3) introduce a novel Generalized Linear Chain Trick (GLCT)
framework that extends the LCT to a much broader family of distributions,
including the flexible phase-type distributions which can approximate
distributions on $\mathbb{R}^+$ and be fit to data. These results give modelers
more flexibility to incorporate appropriate dwell time assumptions into mean
field ODEs, including conditional dwell time distributions, and these results
help clarify connections between individual-level stochastic model assumptions
and the structure of corresponding mean field ODEs.

"  The complexity and size of state-of-the-art cell models have significantly
increased in part due to the requirement that these models possess complex
cellular functions which are thought--but not necessarily proven--to be
important. Modern cell models often involve hundreds of parameters; the values
of these parameters come, more often than not, from animal experiments whose
relationship to the human physiology is weak with very little information on
the errors in these measurements. The concomitant uncertainties in parameter
values result in uncertainties in the model outputs or Quantities of Interest
(QoIs). Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) aims at apportioning to individual
parameters (or sets of parameters) their relative contribution to output
uncertainty thereby introducing a measure of influence or importance of said
parameters. New GSA approaches are required to deal with increased model size
and complexity; a three stage methodology consisting of screening (dimension
reduction), surrogate modeling, and computing Sobol' indices, is presented. The
methodology is used to analyze a physiologically validated numerical model of
neurovascular coupling which possess 160 uncertain parameters. The sensitivity
analysis investigates three quantities of interest (QoIs), the average value of
$K^+$ in the extracellular space, the average volumetric flow rate through the
perfusing vessel, and the minimum value of the actin/myosin complex in the
smooth muscle cell. GSA provides a measure of the influence of each parameter,
for each of the three QoIs, giving insight into areas of possible physiological
dysfunction and areas of further investigation.

"  This work presents an innovative application of the well-known concept of
cortico-muscular coherence for the classification of various motor tasks, i.e.,
grasps of different kinds of objects. Our approach can classify objects with
different weights (motor-related features) and different surface frictions
(haptics-related features) with high accuracy (over 0:8). The outcomes
presented here provide information about the synchronization existing between
the brain and the muscles during specific activities; thus, this may represent
a new effective way to perform activity recognition.

"  We studied how lagged linear regression can be used to detect the physiologic
effects of drugs from data in the electronic health record (EHR). We
systematically examined the effect of methodological variations ((i) time
series construction, (ii) temporal parameterization, (iii) intra-subject
normalization, (iv) differencing (lagged rates of change achieved by taking
differences between consecutive measurements), (v) explanatory variables, and
(vi) regression models) on performance of lagged linear methods in this
context. We generated two gold standards (one knowledge-base derived, one
expert-curated) for expected pairwise relationships between 7 drugs and 4 labs,
and evaluated how the 64 unique combinations of methodological perturbations
reproduce gold standards. Our 28 cohorts included patients in Columbia
University Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital clinical database. The
most accurate methods achieved AUROC of 0.794 for knowledge-base derived gold
standard (95%CI [0.741, 0.847]) and 0.705 for expert-curated gold standard (95%
CI [0.629, 0.781]). We observed a 0.633 mean AUROC (95%CI [0.610, 0.657],
expert-curated gold standard) across all methods that re-parameterize time
according to sequence and use either a joint autoregressive model with
differencing or an independent lag model without differencing. The complement
of this set of methods achieved a mean AUROC close to 0.5, indicating the
importance of these choices. We conclude that time- series analysis of EHR data
will likely rely on some of the beneficial pre-processing and modeling
methodologies identified, and will certainly benefit from continued careful
analysis of methodological perturbations. This study found that methodological
variations, such as pre-processing and representations, significantly affect
results, exposing the importance of evaluating these components when comparing
machine-learning methods.

"  This Perspective provides examples of current and future applications of deep
learning in pharmacogenomics, including: (1) identification of novel regulatory
variants located in noncoding domains and their function as applied to
pharmacoepigenomics; (2) patient stratification from medical records; and (3)
prediction of drugs, targets, and their interactions. Deep learning
encapsulates a family of machine learning algorithms that over the last decade
has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) and
has demonstrated breakthrough performance improvements on a wide range of tasks
in biomedicine. We anticipate that in the future deep learning will be widely

"  Cell migration is a fundamental process involved in physiological phenomena
such as the immune response and morphogenesis, but also in pathological
processes, such as the development of tumor metastasis. These functions are
effectively ensured because cells are active systems that adapt to their
environment. In this work, we consider a migrating cell as an active particle,
where its intracellular activity is responsible for motion. Such system was
already modeled in a previous model where the protrusion activity of the cell
was described by a stochastic Markovian jump process. The model was proven able
to capture the diversity in observed trajectories. Here, we add a description
of the effect of an external chemical attractive signal on the protrusion
dynamics, that may vary in time. We show that the resulting stochastic model is
a well-posed non-homogeneous Markovian process, and provide cell trajectories
in different settings, illustrating the effects of the signal on long-term
trajectories.
"
"  When plated onto substrates, cell morphology and even stem cell
differentiation are influenced by the stiffness of their environment. Stiffer
substrates give strongly spread (eventually polarized) cells with strong focal
adhesions, and stress fibers; very soft substrates give a less developed
cytoskeleton, and much lower cell spreading. The kinetics of this process of
cell spreading is studied extensively, and important universal relationships
are established on how the cell area grows with time. Here we study the
population dynamics of spreading cells, investigating the characteristic
processes involved in cell response to the substrate. We show that unlike the
individual cell morphology, this population dynamics does not depend on the
substrate stiffness. Instead, a strong activation temperature dependence is
observed. Different cell lines on different substrates all have long-time
statistics controlled by the thermal activation over a single energy barrier
dG=19 kcal/mol, while the early-time kinetics follows a power law $t^5$. This
implies that the rate of spreading depends on an internal process of
adhesion-mechanosensing complex assembly and activation: the operational
complex must have 5 component proteins, and the last process in the sequence
(which we believe is the activation of focal adhesion kinase) is controlled by
the binding energy dG.

"  The reproducibility of scientific research has become a point of critical
concern. We argue that openness and transparency are critical for
reproducibility, and we outline an ecosystem for open and transparent science
that has emerged within the human neuroimaging community. We discuss the range
of open data sharing resources that have been developed for neuroimaging data,
and the role of data standards (particularly the Brain Imaging Data Structure)
in enabling the automated sharing, processing, and reuse of large neuroimaging
datasets. We outline how the open-source Python language has provided the basis
for a data science platform that enables reproducible data analysis and

as containerization, provide the basis for greater reproducibility in data
analysis. The emergence of this new ecosystem provides an example for many
areas of science that are currently struggling with reproducibility.

"  Electron Cryo-Tomography (ECT) enables 3D visualization of macromolecule
structure inside single cells. Macromolecule classification approaches based on
convolutional neural networks (CNN) were developed to separate millions of
macromolecules captured from ECT systematically. However, given the fast
accumulation of ECT data, it will soon become necessary to use CNN models to
efficiently and accurately separate substantially more macromolecules at the
prediction stage, which requires additional computational costs. To speed up
the prediction, we compress classification models into compact neural networks
with little in accuracy for deployment. Specifically, we propose to perform
model compression through knowledge distillation. Firstly, a complex teacher
network is trained to generate soft labels with better classification
feasibility followed by training of customized student networks with simple
architectures using the soft label to compress model complexity. Our tests
demonstrate that our compressed models significantly reduce the number of
parameters and time cost while maintaining similar classification accuracy.

"  We show that discrete distributions on the $d$-dimensional non-negative
integer lattice can be approximated arbitrarily well via the marginals of
stationary distributions for various classes of stochastic chemical reaction
networks. We begin by providing a class of detailed balanced networks and prove
that they can approximate any discrete distribution to any desired accuracy.
However, these detailed balanced constructions rely on the ability to
initialize a system precisely, and are therefore susceptible to perturbations
in the initial conditions. We therefore provide another construction based on
the ability to approximate point mass distributions and prove that this
construction is capable of approximating arbitrary discrete distributions for
any choice of initial condition. In particular, the developed models are
ergodic, so their limit distributions are robust to a finite number of
perturbations over time in the counts of molecules.

"  The current dominant visual processing paradigm in both human and machine
research is the feedforward, layered hierarchy of neural-like processing
elements. Within this paradigm, visual saliency is seen by many to have a
specific role, namely that of early selection. Early selection is thought to
enable very fast visual performance by limiting processing to only the most
relevant candidate portions of an image. Though this strategy has indeed led to
improved processing time efficiency in machine algorithms, at least one set of
critical tests of this idea has never been performed with respect to the role
of early selection in human vision. How would the best of the current saliency
models perform on the stimuli used by experimentalists who first provided
evidence for this visual processing paradigm? Would the algorithms really
provide correct candidate sub-images to enable fast categorization on those
same images? Here, we report on a new series of tests of these questions whose
results suggest that it is quite unlikely that such an early selection process
has any role in human rapid visual categorization.

"  This paper presents a new framework for analysing forensic DNA samples using
probabilistic genotyping. Specifically it presents a mathematical framework for
specifying and combining the steps in producing forensic casework
electropherograms of short tandem repeat loci from DNA samples. It is
applicable to both high and low template DNA samples, that is, samples
containing either high or low amounts DNA. A specific model is developed within
the framework, by way of particular modelling assumptions and approximations,
and its interpretive power presented on examples using simulated data and data
from a publicly available dataset. The framework relies heavily on the use of
univariate and multivariate probability generating functions. It is shown that
these provide a succinct and elegant mathematical scaffolding to model the key
steps in the process. A significant development in this paper is that of new
numerical methods for accurately and efficiently evaluating the probability
distribution of amplicons arising from the polymerase chain reaction process,
which is modelled as a discrete multi-type branching process. Source code in
the scripting languages Python, R and Julia is provided for illustration of
these methods. These new developments will be of general interest to persons
working outside the province of forensic DNA interpretation that this paper
focuses on.

"  The understanding of variations in genome sequences assists us in identifying
people who are predisposed to common diseases, solving rare diseases, and
finding the corresponding population group of the individuals from a larger
population group. Although classical machine learning techniques allow
researchers to identify groups (i.e. clusters) of related variables, the
accuracy, and effectiveness of these methods diminish for large and
high-dimensional datasets such as the whole human genome. On the other hand,
deep neural network architectures (the core of deep learning) can better
exploit large-scale datasets to build complex models. In this paper, we use the
K-means clustering approach for scalable genomic data analysis aiming towards
clustering genotypic variants at the population scale. Finally, we train a deep
belief network (DBN) for predicting the geographic ethnicity. We used the
genotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project, which covers the result of genome
sequencing for 2504 individuals from 26 different ethnic origins and comprises
84 million variants. Our experimental results, with a focus on accuracy and
scalability, show the effectiveness and superiority compared to the
state-of-the-art.

"  We study the challenges of applying deep learning to gene expression data. We
find experimentally that there exists non-linear signal in the data, however is
it not discovered automatically given the noise and low numbers of samples used
in most research. We discuss how gene interaction graphs (same pathway,
protein-protein, co-expression, or research paper text association) can be used
to impose a bias on a deep model similar to the spatial bias imposed by
convolutions on an image. We explore the usage of Graph Convolutional Neural
Networks coupled with dropout and gene embeddings to utilize the graph
information. We find this approach provides an advantage for particular tasks
in a low data regime but is very dependent on the quality of the graph used. We
conclude that more work should be done in this direction. We design experiments
that show why existing methods fail to capture signal that is present in the
data when features are added which clearly isolates the problem that needs to
be addressed.

"  Human learning is a complex process in which future behavior is altered via
the modulation of neural activity. Yet, the degree to which brain activity and
functional connectivity during learning is constrained across subjects, for
example by conserved anatomy and physiology or by the nature of the task,
remains unknown. Here, we measured brain activity and functional connectivity
in a longitudinal experiment in which healthy adult human participants learned
the values of novel objects over the course of four days. We assessed the
presence of constraints on activity and functional connectivity using an
inter-subject correlation approach. Constraints on activity and connectivity
were greater in magnitude than expected in a non-parametric permutation-based
null model, particularly in primary sensory and motor systems, as well as in
regions associated with the learning of value. Notably, inter-subject
connectivity in activity and connectivity displayed marked temporal variations,
with inter-subject correlations in activity exceeding those in connectivity
during early learning and \emph{visa versa} in later learning. Finally,
individual differences in performance accuracy tracked the degree to which a
subject's connectivity, but not activity, tracked subject-general patterns.
Taken together, our results support the notion that brain activity and
connectivity are constrained across subjects in early learning, with
constraints on activity, but not connectivity, decreasing in later learning.

"  DNA is a flexible molecule, but the degree of its flexibility is subject to
debate. The commonly-accepted persistence length of $l_p \approx 500\,$\AA\ is
inconsistent with recent studies on short-chain DNA that show much greater
flexibility but do not probe its origin. We have performed X-ray and neutron
small-angle scattering on a short DNA sequence containing a strong nucleosome
positioning element, and analyzed the results using a modified Kratky-Porod
model to determine possible conformations. Our results support a hypothesis
from Crick and Klug in 1975 that some DNA sequences in solution can have sharp
kinks, potentially resolving the discrepancy. Our conclusions are supported by
measurements on a radiation-damaged sample, where single-strand breaks lead to
increased flexibility and by an analysis of data from another sequence, which
does not have kinks, but where our method can detect a locally enhanced
flexibility due to an $AT$-domain.

"  Staphylococcus aureus responsible for nosocomial infections is a significant
threat to the public health. The increasing resistance of S.aureus to various
antibiotics has drawn it to a prime focus for research on designing an
appropriate drug delivery system. Emergence of Methicillin Resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 1961, necessitated the use of vancomycin ""the
drug of last resort"" to treat these infections. Unfortunately, S.aureus has
already started gaining resistances to vancomycin. Liposome encapsulation of
drugs have been earlier shown to provide an efficient method of microbial
inhibition in many cases. We have studied the effect of liposome encapsulated
vancomycin on MRSA and evaluated the antibacterial activity of the
liposome-entrapped drug in comparison to that of the free drug based on the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug. The MIC for liposomal
vancomycin was found to be about half of that of free vancomycin. The growth
response of MRSA showed that the liposomal vancomycin induced the culture to go
into bacteriostatic state and phagocytic killing was enhanced. Administration
of the antibiotic encapsulated in liposome thus was shown to greatly improve
the drug delivery as well as the drug resistance caused by MRSA.
"
"  Calcium imaging data promises to transform the field of neuroscience by
making it possible to record from large populations of neurons simultaneously.
However, determining the exact moment in time at which a neuron spikes, from a
calcium imaging data set, amounts to a non-trivial deconvolution problem which
is of critical importance for downstream analyses. While a number of
formulations have been proposed for this task in the recent literature, in this
paper we focus on a formulation recently proposed in Jewell and Witten (2017)
which has shown initial promising results. However, this proposal is slow to
run on fluorescence traces of hundreds of thousands of timesteps.
Here we develop a much faster online algorithm for solving the optimization
problem of Jewell and Witten (2017) that can be used to deconvolve a
fluorescence trace of 100,000 timesteps in less than a second. Furthermore,
this algorithm overcomes a technical challenge of Jewell and Witten (2017) by
avoiding the occurrence of so-called ""negative"" spikes. We demonstrate that
this algorithm has superior performance relative to existing methods for spike
deconvolution on calcium imaging datasets that were recently released as part
of the spikefinder challenge (this http URL).
Our C++ implementation, along with R and python wrappers, is publicly
available on Github at this https URL.
"
"  Bacterial communities have rich social lives. A well-established interaction
involves the exchange of a public good in Pseudomonas populations, where the
iron-scavenging compound pyoverdine, synthesized by some cells, is shared with
the rest. Pyoverdine thus mediates interactions between producers and
non-producers and can constitute a public good. This interaction is often used
to test game theoretical predictions on the ""social dilemma"" of producers. Such
an approach, however, underestimates the impact of specific properties of the
public good, for example consequences of its accumulation in the environment.
Here, we experimentally quantify costs and benefits of pyoverdine production in
a specific environment, and build a model of population dynamics that
explicitly accounts for the changing significance of accumulating pyoverdine as
chemical mediator of social interactions. The model predicts that, in an
ensemble of growing populations (metapopulation) with different initial
producer fractions (and consequently pyoverdine contents), the global producer
fraction initially increases. Because the benefit of pyoverdine declines at
saturating concentrations, the increase need only be transient. Confirmed by
experiments on metapopulations, our results show how a changing benefit of a
public good can shape social interactions in a bacterial population.

"  In our previous work, we studied an interconnected bursting neuron model for
insect locomotion, and its corresponding phase oscillator model, which at high
speed can generate stable tripod gaits with three legs off the ground
simultaneously in swing, and at low speed can generate stable tetrapod gaits
with two legs off the ground simultaneously in swing. However, at low speed
several other stable locomotion patterns, that are not typically observed as
insect gaits, may coexist. In the present paper, by adding heterogeneous
external input to each oscillator, we modify the bursting neuron model so that
its corresponding phase oscillator model produces only one stable gait at each
speed, specifically: a unique stable tetrapod gait at low speed, a unique
stable tripod gait at high speed, and a unique branch of stable transition
gaits connecting them. This suggests that control signals originating in the
brain and central nervous system can modify gait patterns.
"
"  We introduce coroICA, confounding-robust independent component analysis, a
novel ICA algorithm which decomposes linearly mixed multivariate observations
into independent components that are corrupted (and rendered dependent) by
hidden group-wise stationary confounding. It extends the ordinary ICA model in
a theoretically sound and explicit way to incorporate group-wise (or
environment-wise) confounding. We show that our general noise model allows to
perform ICA in settings where other noisy ICA procedures fail. Additionally, it
can be used for applications with grouped data by adjusting for different
stationary noise within each group. We show that the noise model has a natural
relation to causality and explain how it can be applied in the context of
causal inference. In addition to our theoretical framework, we provide an
efficient estimation procedure and prove identifiability of the unmixing matrix
under mild assumptions. Finally, we illustrate the performance and robustness
of our method on simulated data, provide audible and visual examples, and
demonstrate the applicability to real-world scenarios by experiments on
publicly available Antarctic ice core data as well as two EEG data sets. We
provide a scikit-learn compatible pip-installable Python package coroICA as
well as R and Matlab implementations accompanied by a documentation at
this https URL.

"  The field of brain-computer interfaces is poised to advance from the
traditional goal of controlling prosthetic devices using brain signals to
combining neural decoding and encoding within a single neuroprosthetic device.
Such a device acts as a ""co-processor"" for the brain, with applications ranging
from inducing Hebbian plasticity for rehabilitation after brain injury to
reanimating paralyzed limbs and enhancing memory. We review recent progress in
simultaneous decoding and encoding for closed-loop control and plasticity
induction. To address the challenge of multi-channel decoding and encoding, we
introduce a unifying framework for developing brain co-processors based on
artificial neural networks and deep learning. These ""neural co-processors"" can
be used to jointly optimize cost functions with the nervous system to achieve
desired behaviors ranging from targeted neuro-rehabilitation to augmentation of
brain function.
"
"  NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) typically contribute to excitatory synaptic
transmission in the central nervous system. While calcium influx through NMDA-R
plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, indirect experimental evidence
also exists demonstrating actions of NMDAR-mediated calcium influx on neuronal
excitability through the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels.
But, so far, this mechanism has not been studied theoretically. Our theoretical
model provide a simple description of neuronal electrical activity including
the tonic activity of NMDA receptors and a cytosolic calcium compartment. We
show that calcium influx through NMDA-R can directly be coupled to activation
of calcium-activated potassium channels providing an overall inhibitory effect
on neuronal excitability. Furthermore, the presence of tonic NMDA-R activity
promotes bistability in electrical activity by dramatically increasing the
stimulus interval where both a stable steady state and repetitive firing can
exist. This results could provide an intrinsic mechanism for the constitution
of memory traces in neuronal circuits. They also shed light on the way by which
beta-amyloids can decrease neuronal activity when interfering with NMDA-R in
Alzheimer's disease.
"
"  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) possess energy-efficient potential due to
event-based computation. However, supervised training of SNNs remains a
challenge as spike activities are non-differentiable. Previous SNNs training
methods can basically be categorized into two classes, backpropagation-like
training methods and plasticity-based learning methods. The former methods are
dependent on energy-inefficient real-valued computation and non-local
transmission, as also required in artificial neural networks (ANNs), while the
latter either be considered biologically implausible or exhibit poor
performance. Hence, biologically plausible (bio-plausible) high-performance
supervised learning (SL) methods for SNNs remain deficient. In this paper, we
proposed a novel bio-plausible SNN model for SL based on the symmetric
spike-timing dependent plasticity (sym-STDP) rule found in neuroscience. By
combining the sym-STDP rule with bio-plausible synaptic scaling and intrinsic
plasticity of the dynamic threshold, our SNN model implemented SL well and
achieved good performance in the benchmark recognition task (MNIST). To reveal
the underlying mechanism of our SL model, we visualized both layer-based
activities and synaptic weights using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE) method after training and found that they were well
clustered, thereby demonstrating excellent classification ability. As the
learning rules were bio-plausible and based purely on local spike events, our
model could be easily applied to neuromorphic hardware for online training and
may be helpful for understanding SL information processing at the synaptic
level in biological neural systems.

"  This paper describes a micro fluorescence in situ hybridization
({\mu}FISH)-based rapid detection of cytogenetic biomarkers on formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. We demonstrated this method in the
context of detecting human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) in breast tissue
sections. This method uses a non-contact microfluidic scanning probe (MFP),
which localizes FISH probes at the micrometer length-scale to selected cells of
the tissue section. The scanning ability of the MFP allows for a versatile
implementation of FISH on tissue sections. We demonstrated the use of
oligonucleotide FISH probes in ethylene carbonate-based buffer enabling rapid
hybridization within < 1 min for chromosome enumeration and 10-15 min for
assessment of the HER2 status in FFPE sections. We further demonstrated
recycling of FISH probes for multiple sequential tests using a defined volume
of probes by forming hierarchical hydrodynamic flow confinements. This
microscale method is compatible with the standard FISH protocols and with the
Instant Quality (IQ) FISH assay, reduces the FISH probe consumption ~100-fold
and the hybridization time 4-fold, resulting in an assay turnaround time of < 3
h. We believe rapid {\mu}FISH has the potential of being used in pathology
workflows as a standalone method or in combination with other molecular methods
for diagnostic and prognostic analysis of FFPE sections.

"  Background. Models of cancer-induced neuropathy are designed by injecting
cancer cells near the peripheral nerves. The interference of tissue-resident
immune cells does not allow a direct contact with nerve fibres which affects
the tumor microenvironment and the invasion process. Methods. Anaplastic
tumor-1 (AT-1) cells were inoculated within the sciatic nerves (SNs) of male
Copenhagen rats. Lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the SNs were collected
on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. SN tissues were examined for morphological changes
and DRG tissues for immunofluorescence, electrophoretic tendency, and mRNA
quantification. Hypersensitivities to cold, mechanical, and thermal stimuli
were determined. HC-030031, a selective TRPA1 antagonist, was used to treat
cold allodynia. Results. Nociception thresholds were identified on day 6.
Immunofluorescent micrographs showed overexpression of TRPA1 on days 7 and 14
and of CGRP on day 14 until day 21. Both TRPA1 and CGRP were coexpressed on the
same cells. Immunoblots exhibited an increase in TRPA1 expression on day 14.
TRPA1 mRNA underwent an increase on day 7 (normalized to 18S). Injection of
HC-030031 transiently reversed the cold allodynia. Conclusion. A novel and a
promising model of cancer-induced neuropathy was established, and the role of
TRPA1 and CGRP in pain transduction was examined.

"  Machine learning can extract information from neural recordings, e.g.,
surface EEG, ECoG and {\mu}ECoG, and therefore plays an important role in many
research and clinical applications. Deep learning with artificial neural
networks has recently seen increasing attention as a new approach in brain
signal decoding. Here, we apply a deep learning approach using convolutional
neural networks to {\mu}ECoG data obtained with a wireless, chronically
implanted system in an ovine animal model. Regularized linear discriminant
analysis (rLDA), a filter bank component spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm and
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) were applied to auditory evoked
responses captured by {\mu}ECoG. We show that compared with rLDA and FBCSP,
significantly higher decoding accuracy can be obtained by ConvNets trained in
an end-to-end manner, i.e., without any predefined signal features. Deep
learning thus proves a promising technique for {\mu}ECoG-based brain-machine
interfacing applications.

"  We focus on two supervised visual reasoning tasks whose labels encode a
semantic relational rule between two or more objects in an image: the MNIST
Parity task and the colorized Pentomino task. The objects in the images undergo
random translation, scaling, rotation and coloring transformations. Thus these
tasks involve invariant relational reasoning. We report uneven performance of
various deep CNN models on these two tasks. For the MNIST Parity task, we
report that the VGG19 model soundly outperforms a family of ResNet models.
Moreover, the family of ResNet models exhibits a general sensitivity to random
initialization for the MNIST Parity task. For the colorized Pentomino task, now
both the VGG19 and ResNet models exhibit sluggish optimization and very poor
test generalization, hovering around 30% test error. The CNN we tested all
learn hierarchies of fully distributed features and thus encode the distributed
representation prior. We are motivated by a hypothesis from cognitive
neuroscience which posits that the human visual cortex is modularized, and this
allows the visual cortex to learn higher order invariances. To this end, we
consider a modularized variant of the ResNet model, referred to as a Residual
Mixture Network (ResMixNet) which employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to
interleave distributed representations with more specialized, modular
representations. We show that very shallow ResMixNets are capable of learning
each of the two tasks well, attaining less than 2% and 1% test error on the
MNIST Parity and the colorized Pentomino tasks respectively. Most importantly,
the ResMixNet models are extremely parameter efficient: generalizing better
than various non-modular CNNs that have over 10x the number of parameters.
These experimental results support the hypothesis that modularity is a robust
prior for learning invariant relational reasoning.

"  The cortex exhibits self-sustained highly-irregular activity even under
resting conditions, whose origin and function need to be fully understood. It
is believed that this can be described as an ""asynchronous state"" stemming from
the balance between excitation and inhibition, with important consequences for
information-processing, though a competing hypothesis claims it stems from
critical dynamics. By analyzing a parsimonious neural-network model with
excitatory and inhibitory interactions, we elucidate a noise-induced mechanism
called ""Jensen's force"" responsible for the emergence of a novel phase of
arbitrarily-low but self-sustained activity, which reproduces all the
experimental features of asynchronous states. The simplicity of our framework
allows for a deep understanding of asynchronous states from a broad
statistical-mechanics perspective and of the phase transitions to other
standard phases it exhibits, opening the door to reconcile, asynchronous-state
and critical-state hypotheses. We argue that Jensen's forces are measurable
experimentally and might be relevant in contexts beyond neuroscience.
"
"  First-passage times in random walks have a vast number of diverse
applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. In general,
environmental conditions for a stochastic process are not constant on the time
scale of the average first-passage time, or control might be applied to reduce
noise. We investigate moments of the first-passage time distribution under a
transient describing relaxation of environmental conditions. We solve the
Laplace-transformed (generalized) master equation analytically using a novel
method that is applicable to general state schemes. The first-passage time from
one end to the other of a linear chain of states is our application for the
solutions. The dependence of its average on the relaxation rate obeys a power
law for slow transients. The exponent $\nu$ depends on the chain length $N$
like $\nu=-N/(N+1)$ to leading order. Slow transients substantially reduce the
noise of first-passage times expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV),
even if the average first-passage time is much longer than the transient. The
CV has a pronounced minimum for some lengths, which we call resonant lengths.
These results also suggest a simple and efficient noise control strategy, and
are closely related to the timing of repetitive excitations, coherence
resonance and information transmission by noisy excitable systems. A resonant
number of steps from the inhibited state to the excitation threshold and slow
recovery from negative feedback provide optimal timing noise reduction and
information transmission.
"
"  The log-det distance between two aligned DNA sequences was introduced as a
tool for statistically consistent inference of a gene tree under simple
non-mixture models of sequence evolution. Here we prove that the log-det
distance, coupled with a distance-based tree construction method, also permits
consistent inference of species trees under mixture models appropriate to
aligned genomic-scale sequences data. Data may include sites from many genetic
loci, which evolved on different gene trees due to incomplete lineage sorting
on an ultrametric species tree, with different time-reversible substitution
processes. The simplicity and speed of distance-based inference suggests
log-det based methods should serve as benchmarks for judging more elaborate and
computationally-intensive species trees inference methods.

"  Political and social polarization are a significant cause of conflict and
poor governance in many societies, thus understanding their causes is of
considerable importance. Here we demonstrate that shifts in socialization
strategy similar to political polarization and/or identity politics could be a
constructive response to periods of apparent economic decline. We start from
the observation that economies, like ecologies are seldom at equilibrium.
Rather, they often suffer both negative and positive shocks. We show that even
where in an expanding economy, interacting with diverse out-groups can afford
benefits through innovation and exploration, if that economy contracts, a
strategy of seeking homogeneous groups can be important to maintaining
individual solvency. This is true even where the expected value of out group
interaction exceeds that of in group interactions. Our account unifies what
were previously seen as conflicting explanations: identity threat versus
economic anxiety. Our model indicates that in periods of extreme deprivation,
cooperation with diversity again becomes the best (in fact, only viable)
strategy. However, our model also shows that while polarization may increase
gradually in response to shifts in the economy, gradual decrease of
polarization may not be an available strategy; thus returning to previous
levels of cooperation may require structural change.

"  Large bundles of myelinated axons, called white matter, anatomically connect
disparate brain regions together and compose the structural core of the human
connectome. We recently proposed a method of measuring the local integrity
along the length of each white matter fascicle, termed the local connectome. If
communication efficiency is fundamentally constrained by the integrity along
the entire length of a white matter bundle, then variability in the functional
dynamics of brain networks should be associated with variability in the local
connectome. We test this prediction using two statistical approaches that are
capable of handling the high dimensionality of data. First, by performing
statistical inference on distance-based correlations, we show that similarity
in the local connectome between individuals is significantly correlated with
similarity in their patterns of functional connectivity. Second, by employing
variable selection using sparse canonical correlation analysis and
cross-validation, we show that segments of the local connectome are predictive
of certain patterns of functional brain dynamics. These results are consistent
with the hypothesis that structural variability along axon bundles constrains
communication between disparate brain regions.

"  Mounting evidence connects the biomechanical properties of tissues to the
development of eye diseases such as keratoconus, a common disease in which the
cornea thins and bulges into a conical shape. However, measuring biomechanical
changes in vivo with sufficient sensitivity for disease detection has proved
challenging. Here, we present a first large-scale study (~200 subjects,
including normal and keratoconus patients) using Brillouin light-scattering
microscopy to measure longitudinal modulus in corneal tissues with high
sensitivity and spatial resolution. Our results in vivo provide evidence of
biomechanical inhomogeneity at the onset of keratoconus and suggest that
biomechanical asymmetry between the left and right eyes may presage disease
development. We additionally measure the stiffening effect of corneal
crosslinking treatment in vivo for the first time. Our results demonstrate the
promise of Brillouin microscopy for diagnosis and treatment of keratoconus, and
potentially other diseases.

"  Cross-correlations in the activity in neural networks are commonly used to
characterize their dynamical states and their anatomical and functional
organizations. Yet, how these latter network features affect the spatiotemporal
structure of the correlations in recurrent networks is not fully understood.
Here, we develop a general theory for the emergence of correlated neuronal
activity from the dynamics in strongly recurrent networks consisting of several
populations of binary neurons. We apply this theory to the case in which the
connectivity depends on the anatomical or functional distance between the
neurons. We establish the architectural conditions under which the system
settles into a dynamical state where correlations are strong, highly robust and
spatially modulated. We show that such strong correlations arise if the network
exhibits an effective feedforward structure. We establish how this feedforward
structure determines the way correlations scale with the network size and the
degree of the connectivity. In networks lacking an effective feedforward
structure correlations are extremely small and only weakly depend on the number
of connections per neuron. Our work shows how strong correlations can be
consistent with highly irregular activity in recurrent networks, two key
features of neuronal dynamics in the central nervous system.

"  Partial differential equations with distributional sources---in particular,
involving (derivatives of) delta distributions---have become increasingly
ubiquitous in numerous areas of physics and applied mathematics. It is often of
considerable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but any
singular (""particle""-like) source modeling invariably introduces nontrivial
computational obstacles. A common method to circumvent these is through some
form of delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid;
however, this often carries significant limitations on the efficiency of the
numerical convergence rates, or sometimes even the resolvability of the problem
at all.
In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such
equations which avoids the singular behavior entirely: the
""Particle-without-Particle"" method. Previously introduced in the context of the
self-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to discretize the
computational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral
(Chebyshev-Lobatto) grids such that the ""particle"" is always at the interface
between them; thus, one only needs to solve homogeneous equations in each
domain, with the source effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions
thereon. We prove here that this method yields solutions to any linear PDE the
source of which is any linear combination of delta distributions and
derivatives thereof supported on a one-dimensional subspace of the problem
domain. We then implement it to numerically solve a variety of relevant PDEs:
hyperbolic (with applications to neuroscience and acoustics), parabolic (with
applications to finance), and elliptic. We generically obtain improved
convergence rates relative to typical past implementations relying on delta
function approximations.

"  Volvox barberi is a multicellular green alga forming spherical colonies of
10000-50000 differentiated somatic and germ cells. Here, I show that these
colonies actively self-organize over minutes into ""flocks"" that can contain
more than 100 colonies moving and rotating collectively for hours. The colonies
in flocks form two-dimensional, irregular, ""active crystals"", with lattice
angles and colony diameters both following log-normal distributions. Comparison
with a dynamical simulation of soft spheres with diameters matched to the
Volvox samples, and a weak long-range attractive force, show that the Volvox
flocks achieve optimal random close-packing. A dye tracer in the Volvox medium
revealed large hydrodynamic vortices generated by colony and flock rotations,
providing a likely source of the forces leading to flocking and optimal
packing.

"  Recent developments in specialized computer hardware have greatly accelerated
atomic level Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. A single GPU-attached cluster
is capable of producing microsecond-length trajectories in reasonable amounts
of time. Multiple protein states and a large number of microstates associated
with folding and with the function of the protein can be observed as
conformations sampled in the trajectories. Clustering those conformations,
however, is needed for identifying protein states, evaluating transition rates
and understanding protein behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel
data-driven generative conformation clustering method based on the adversarial
autoencoder (AAE) and provide the associated software implementation Cong. The
method was tested using a 208 microseconds MD simulation of the fast-folding
peptide Trp-Cage (20 residues) obtained from the D.E. Shaw Research Group. The
proposed clustering algorithm identifies many of the salient features of the
folding process by grouping a large number of conformations that share common
features not easily identifiable in the trajectory.

"  The same concept can mean different things or be instantiated in different
forms depending on context, suggesting a degree of flexibility within the
conceptual system. We propose that a compositional network model can be used to
capture and predict this flexibility. We modeled individual concepts (e.g.,
BANANA, BOTTLE) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g.,
YELLOW, SWEET) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In
this framework, networks capture the within-concept statistics that reflect how
properties correlate with each other across instances of a concept. We ran a
classification analysis using graph eigendecomposition to validate these
models, and find that these models can successfully discriminate between object
concepts. We then computed formal measures from these concept networks and
explored their relationship to conceptual structure. We find that diversity
coefficients and core-periphery structure can be interpreted as network-based
measures of conceptual flexibility and stability, respectively. These results
support the feasibility of a concept network framework and highlight its
ability to formally capture important characteristics of the conceptual system.

"  The Moon often appears larger near the perceptual horizon and smaller high in
the sky though the visual angle subtended is invariant. We show how this
illusion results from the optimization of a projective geometrical frame for
conscious perception through free energy minimization, as articulated in the
Projective Consciousness Model. The model accounts for all documented
modulations of the illusion without anomalies (e.g., the size-distance
paradox), surpasses other theories in explanatory power, makes sense of inter-
and intra-subjective variability vis-a-vis the illusion, and yields new
quantitative and qualitative predictions.

"  Computational procedures to foresee the 3D structure of aptamers are in
continuous progress. They constitute a crucial input to research, mainly when
the crystallographic counterpart of the structures in silico produced is not
present. At now, many codes are able to perform structure and binding
prediction, although their ability in scoring the results remains rather weak.
In this paper, we propose a novel procedure to complement the ranking outcomes
of free docking code, by applying it to a set of anti-angiopoietin aptamers,
whose performances are known. We rank the in silico produced configurations,
adopting a maximum likelihood estimate, based on their topological and
electrical properties. From the analysis, two principal kinds of conformers are
identified, whose ability to mimick the binding features of the natural
receptor is discussed. The procedure is easily generalizable to many biological
biomolecules, useful for increasing chances of success in designing
high-specificity biosensors (aptasensors).

"  Diagnosis and risk stratification of cancer and many other diseases require
the detection of genomic breakpoints as a prerequisite of calling copy number
alterations (CNA). This, however, is still challenging and requires
time-consuming manual curation. As deep-learning methods outperformed classical
state-of-the-art algorithms in various domains and have also been successfully
applied to life science problems including medicine and biology, we here
propose Deep SNP, a novel Deep Neural Network to learn from genomic data.
Specifically, we used a manually curated dataset from 12 genomic single
nucleotide polymorphism array (SNPa) profiles as truth-set and aimed at
predicting the presence or absence of genomic breakpoints, an indicator of
structural chromosomal variations, in windows of 40,000 probes. We compare our
results with well-known neural network models as well as Rawcopy though this
tool is designed to predict breakpoints and in addition genomic segments with
high sensitivity. We show, that Deep SNP is capable of successfully predicting
the presence or absence of a breakpoint in large genomic windows and
outperforms state-of-the-art neural network models. Qualitative examples
suggest that integration of a localization unit may enable breakpoint detection
and prediction of genomic segments, even if the breakpoint coordinates were not
provided for network training. These results warrant further evaluation of
DeepSNP for breakpoint localization and subsequent calling of genomic segments.

"  The chemotactic dynamics of cells and organisms that have no specialized
gradient sensing organelles is not well understood. In fact, chemotaxis of this
sort of organism is especially challenging to explain when the external
chemical gradient is so small as to make variations of concentrations minute
over the length of each of the organisms. Experimental evidence lends support
to the conjecture that chemotactic behavior of chains of cells can be achieved
via cell-to-cell communication. This is the chemotactic basis for the Local
Excitation, Global Inhibition (LEGI) model.
A generalization of the model for the communication component of the LEGI
model is proposed. Doing so permits us to study in detail how gradient sensing
changes as a function of the structure of the communication term. The key
findings of this study are, an accounting of how gradient sensing is affected
by the competition of communication and diffusive processes; the determination
of the scale dependence of the model outcomes; the sensitivity of communication
to parameters in the model. Together with an essential analysis of the dynamics
of the model, these findings can prove useful in suggesting experiments aimed
at determining the viability of a communication mechanism in chemotactic
dynamics of chains and networks of cells exposed to a chemical concentration
gradient.

"  The oddball paradigm is widely applied to the investigation of multiple
cognitive functions. Prior studies have explored the cortical oscillation and
power spectral differing from the resting-state conduction to oddball paradigm,
but whether brain networks existing the significant difference is still
unclear. Our study addressed how the brain reconfigures its architecture from a
resting-state condition (i.e., baseline) to P300 stimulus task in the visual
oddball paradigm. In this study, electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets were
collected from 24 postgraduate students, who were required to only mentally
count the number of target stimulus; afterwards the functional EEG networks
constructed in different frequency bands were compared between baseline and
oddball task conditions to evaluate the reconfiguration of functional network
in the brain. Compared to the baseline, our results showed the significantly (p
< 0.05) enhanced delta/theta EEG connectivity and decreased alpha default mode
network in the progress of brain reconfiguration to the P300 task. Furthermore,
the reconfigured coupling strengths were demonstrated to relate to P300
amplitudes, which were then regarded as input features to train a classifier to
differentiate the high and low P300 amplitudes groups with an accuracy of
77.78%. The findings of our study help us to understand the changes of
functional brain connectivity from resting-state to oddball stimulus task, and
the reconfigured network pattern has the potential for the selection of good
subjects for P300-based brain- computer interface.

"  The analysis of neuroimaging data poses several strong challenges, in
particular, due to its high dimensionality, its strong spatio-temporal
correlation and the comparably small sample sizes of the respective datasets.
To address these challenges, conventional decoding approaches such as the
searchlight reduce the complexity of the decoding problem by considering local
clusters of voxels only. Thereby, neglecting the distributed spatial patterns
of brain activity underlying many cognitive states. In this work, we introduce
the DLight framework, which overcomes these challenges by utilizing a long
short-term memory unit (LSTM) based deep neural network architecture to analyze
the spatial dependency structure of whole-brain fMRI data. In order to maintain
interpretability of the neuroimaging data, we adapt the layer-wise relevance
propagation (LRP) method. Thereby, we enable the neuroscientist user to study
the learned association of the LSTM between the data and the cognitive state of
the individual. We demonstrate the versatility of DLight by applying it to a
large fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project. We show that the decoding
performance of our method scales better with large datasets, and moreover
outperforms conventional decoding approaches, while still detecting
physiologically appropriate brain areas for the cognitive states classified. We
also demonstrate that DLight is able to detect these areas on several levels of
data granularity (i.e., group, subject, trial, time point).
"
"  We consider the problem of estimating species trees from unrooted gene tree
topologies in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, a common phenomenon
that creates gene tree heterogeneity in multilocus datasets. One popular class
of reconstruction methods in this setting is based on internode distances, i.e.
the average graph distance between pairs of species across gene trees. While
statistical consistency in the limit of large numbers of loci has been
established in some cases, little is known about the sample complexity of such
methods. Here we make progress on this question by deriving a lower bound on
the worst-case variance of internode distance which depends linearly on the
corresponding graph distance in the species tree. We also discuss some
algorithmic implications.

"  Experimental determination of protein function is resource-consuming. As an
alternative, computational prediction of protein function has received
attention. In this context, protein structural classification (PSC) can help,
by allowing for determining structural classes of currently unclassified
proteins based on their features, and then relying on the fact that proteins
with similar structures have similar functions. Existing PSC approaches rely on
sequence-based or direct (""raw"") 3-dimensional (3D) structure-based protein
features. In contrast, we first model 3D structures as protein structure
networks (PSNs). Then, we use (""processed"") network-based features for PSC. We
propose the use of graphlets, state-of-the-art features in many domains of
network science, in the task of PSC. Moreover, because graphlets can deal only
with unweighted PSNs, and because accounting for edge weights when constructing
PSNs could improve PSC accuracy, we also propose a deep learning framework that
automatically learns network features from the weighted PSNs. When evaluated on
a large set of ~9,400 CATH and ~12,800 SCOP protein domains (spanning 36 PSN
sets), our proposed approaches are superior to existing PSC approaches in terms
of accuracy, with comparable running time.
"
"  A rigorous bridge between spiking-level and macroscopic quantities is an
on-going and well-developed story for asynchronously firing neurons, but focus
has shifted to include neural populations exhibiting varying synchronous
dynamics. Recent literature has used the Ott--Antonsen ansatz (2008) to great
effect, allowing a rigorous derivation of an order parameter for large
oscillator populations. The ansatz has been successfully applied using several
models including networks of Kuramoto oscillators, theta models, and
integrate-and-fire neurons, along with many types of network topologies. In the
present study, we take a converse approach: given the mean field dynamics of
slow synapses, predict the synchronization properties of finite neural
populations. The slow synapse assumption is amenable to averaging theory and
the method of multiple timescales. Our proposed theory applies to two
heterogeneous populations of N excitatory n-dimensional and N inhibitory
m-dimensional oscillators with homogeneous synaptic weights. We then
demonstrate our theory using two examples. In the first example we take a
network of excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons and consider the case with
and without heterogeneous inputs. In the second example we use Traub models
with calcium for the excitatory neurons and Wang-Buzs{á}ki models for the
inhibitory neurons. We accurately predict phase drift and phase locking in each
example even when the slow synapses exhibit non-trivial mean-field dynamics.
"
"  Animal telemetry data are often analysed with discrete time movement models
assuming rotation in the movement. These models are defined with equidistant
distant time steps. However, telemetry data from marine animals are observed
irregularly. To account for irregular data, a time-irregularised
first-difference correlated random walk model with drift is introduced. The
model generalizes the commonly used first-difference correlated random walk
with regular time steps by allowing irregular time steps, including a drift
term, and by allowing different autocorrelation in the two coordinates. The
model is applied to data from a ringed seal collected through the Argos
satellite system, and is compared to related movement models through
simulations. Accounting for irregular data in the movement model results in
accurate parameter estimates and reconstruction of movement paths. Measured by
distance, the introduced model can provide more accurate movement paths than
the regular time counterpart. Extracting accurate movement paths from uncertain
telemetry data is important for evaluating space use patterns for marine
animals, which in turn is crucial for management. Further, handling irregular
data directly in the movement model allows efficient simultaneous analysis of
several animals.

"  Tree-grass coexistence in savanna ecosystems depends strongly on
environmental disturbances out of which crucial is fire. Most modeling attempts
in the literature lack stochastic approach to fire occurrences which is
essential to reflect their unpredictability. Existing models that actually
include stochasticity of fire are usually analyzed only numerically. We
introduce new minimalistic model of tree-grass coexistence where fires occur
according to stochastic process. We use the tools of linear semigroup theory to
provide more careful mathematical analysis of the model. Essentially we show
that there exists a unique stationary distribution of tree and grass biomasses.
"
"  Piscine orthoreovirus Strain PRV-1 is the causative agent of heart and
skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Given its
high prevalence in net pen salmon, debate has arisen on whether PRV poses a
risk to migratory salmon, especially in British Columbia (BC) where
commercially important wild Pacific salmon are in decline. Various strains of
PRV have been associated with diseases in Pacific salmon, including
erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS), HSMI-like disease, and
jaundice/anemia in Japan, Norway, Chile and Canada. We examine the
developmental pathway of HSMI and jaundice/anemia associated with PRV-1 in
farmed Atlantic and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon in BC,
respectively. In situ hybridization localized PRV-1 within developing lesions
in both diseases. The two diseases showed dissimilar pathological pathways,
with inflammatory lesions in heart and skeletal muscle in Atlantic salmon, and
degenerative-necrotic lesions in kidney and liver in Chinook salmon, plausibly
explained by differences in PRV load tolerance in red blood cells. Viral genome
sequencing revealed no consistent differences in PRV-1 variants intimately
involved in the development of both diseases, suggesting that migratory Chinook
salmon may be at more than a minimal risk of disease from exposure to the high
levels of PRV occurring on salmon farms.
"
"  The exchange of small molecular signals within microbial populations is
generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS). QS is ubiquitous in nature and
enables microorganisms to respond to fluctuations of living environments by
working together. In this work, a QS-based communication system within a
microbial population in a two-dimensional (2D) environment is analytically
modeled. Notably, the diffusion and degradation of signaling molecules within
the population is characterized. Microorganisms are randomly distributed on a
2D circle where each one releases molecules at random times. The number of
molecules observed at each randomly-distributed bacterium is analyzed. Using
this analysis and some approximation, the expected density of cooperating
bacteria is derived. The analytical results are validated via a particle-based
simulation method. The model can be used to predict and control behavioral
dynamics of microscopic populations that have imperfect signal propagation.

"  Osteonecrosis occurs due to the loss of blood supply to the bone, leading to
spontaneous death of the trabecular bone. Delayed treatment of the involved
patients results in collapse of the femoral head, which leads to a need for
total hip arthroplasty surgery. Core decompression, as the most popular
technique for treatment of the osteonecrosis, includes removal of the lesion
area by drilling a straight tunnel to the lesion, debriding the dead bone and
replacing it with bone substitutes. However, there are two drawbacks for this
treatment method. First, due to the rigidity of the instruments currently used
during core decompression, lesions cannot be completely removed and/or
excessive healthy bone may also be removed with the lesion. Second, the use of
bone substitutes, despite its biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, may not
provide sufficient mechanical strength and support for the bone. To address
these shortcomings, a novel robot-assisted curved core decompression (CCD)
technique is introduced to provide surgeons with direct access to the lesions
causing minimal damage to the healthy bone. In this study, with the aid of
finite element (FE) simulations, we investigate biomechanical performance of
core decompression using the curved drilling technique in the presence of
normal gait loading. In this regard, we compare the result of the CCD using
bone substitutes and flexible implants with other conventional core
decompression techniques. The study finding shows that the maximum principal
stress occurring at the superior domain of the neck is smaller in the CCD
techniques (i.e. 52.847 MPa) compared to the other core decompression methods.

"  Rapid popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing permits
neuroscientists to collect multilevel and multichannel brain data to better
understand brain functions, diagnose diseases, and devise treatments. To ensure
secure and reliable data communication between end-to-end (E2E) devices
supported by current IoT and cloud infrastructure, trust management is needed
at the IoT and user ends. This paper introduces a Neuro-Fuzzy based
Brain-inspired trust management model (TMM) to secure IoT devices and relay
nodes, and to ensure data reliability. The proposed TMM utilizes node
behavioral trust and data trust estimated using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
System and weighted-additive methods respectively to assess the nodes
trustworthiness. In contrast to the existing fuzzy based TMMs, the NS2
simulation results confirm the robustness and accuracy of the proposed TMM in
identifying malicious nodes in the communication network. With the growing
usage of cloud based IoT frameworks in Neuroscience research, integrating the
proposed TMM into the existing infrastructure will assure secure and reliable
data communication among the E2E devices.

"  Quantum Cognition has delivered a number of models for semantic memory, but
to date these have tended to assume pure states and projective measurement.
Here we relax these assumptions. A quantum inspired model of human word
association experiments will be extended using a density matrix representation
of human memory and a POVM based upon non-ideal measurements. Our formulation
allows for a consideration of key terms like measurement and contextuality
within a rigorous modern approach. This approach both provides new conceptual
advances and suggests new experimental protocols.

"  $\textbf{Objective}$: To assess the validity of an automatic EEG arousal
detection algorithm using large patient samples and different heterogeneous
databases
$\textbf{Methods}$: Automatic scorings were confronted with results from
human expert scorers on a total of 2768 full-night PSG recordings obtained from
two different databases. Of them, 472 recordings were obtained during clinical
routine at our sleep center and were subdivided into two subgroups of 220
(HMC-S) and 252 (HMC-M) recordings each, attending to the procedure followed by
the clinical expert during the visual review (semi-automatic or purely manual,
respectively). In addition, 2296 recordings from the public SHHS-2 database
were evaluated against the respective manual expert scorings.
$\textbf{Results}$: Event-by-event epoch-based validation resulted in an
overall Cohen kappa agreement K = 0.600 (HMC-S), 0.559 (HMC-M), and 0.573
(SHHS-2). Estimated inter-scorer variability on the datasets was, respectively,
K = 0.594, 0.561 and 0.543. Analyses of the corresponding Arousal Index scores
showed associated automatic-human repeatability indices ranging in 0.693-0.771
(HMC-S), 0.646-0.791 (HMC-M), and 0.759-0.791 (SHHS-2).
$\textbf{Conclusions}$: Large-scale validation of our automatic EEG arousal
detector on different databases has shown robust performance and good
generalization results comparable to the expected levels of human agreement.
Special emphasis has been put on allowing reproducibility of the results and
implementation of our method has been made accessible online as open source
code

"  This paper gives a new flavor of what Peter Jagers and his co-authors call
`the path to extinction'. In a neutral population with constant size $N$, we
assume that each individual at time $0$ carries a distinct type, or allele. We
consider the joint dynamics of these $N$ alleles, for example the dynamics of
their respective frequencies and more plainly the nonincreasing process
counting the number of alleles remaining by time $t$. We call this process the
extinction process. We show that in the Moran model, the extinction process is
distributed as the process counting (in backward time) the number of common
ancestors to the whole population, also known as the block counting process of
the $N$-Kingman coalescent. Stimulated by this result, we investigate: (1)
whether it extends to an identity between the frequencies of blocks in the
Kingman coalescent and the frequencies of alleles in the extinction process,
both evaluated at jump times; (2) whether it extends to the general case of
$\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes.

"  Most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS) require that users perform mental tasks such as motor
imagery, mental arithmetic, or music imagery to convey a message or to answer
simple yes or no questions. These cognitive tasks usually have no direct
association with the communicative intent, which makes them difficult for users
to perform. In this paper, a 3-class intuitive BCI is presented which enables
users to directly answer yes or no questions by covertly rehearsing the word
'yes' or 'no' for 15 s. The BCI also admits an equivalent duration of
unconstrained rest which constitutes the third discernable task. Twelve
participants each completed one offline block and six online blocks over the
course of 2 sessions. The mean value of the change in oxygenated hemoglobin
concentration during a trial was calculated for each channel and used to train
a regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) classifier. By the final
online block, 9 out of 12 participants were performing above chance (p<0.001),
with a 3-class accuracy of 83.8+9.4%. Even when considering all participants,
the average online 3-class accuracy over the last 3 blocks was 64.1+20.6%, with
only 3 participants scoring below chance (p<0.001). For most participants,
channels in the left temporal and temporoparietal cortex provided the most
discriminative information. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an
online fNIRS 3-class imagined speech BCI. Our findings suggest that imagined
speech can be used as a reliable activation task for selected users for the
development of more intuitive BCIs for communication.

"  The human brain is capable of diverse feats of intelligence. A particularly
salient example is the ability to deduce structure from time-varying auditory
and visual stimuli, enabling humans to master the rules of language and to
build rich expectations of their physical environment. The broad relevance of
this ability for human cognition motivates the need for a first-principles
model explicating putative mechanisms. Here we propose a general framework for
structural learning in the brain, composed of an evolving, high-dimensional
dynamical system driven by external stimuli or internal processes. We
operationalize the scenario in which humans learn the rules that generate a
sequence of stimuli, rather than the exemplar stimuli themselves. We model
external stimuli as seemingly disordered chaotic time series generated by
complex dynamical systems; the underlying structure being deduced is then that
of the corresponding chaotic attractor. This approach allows us to demonstrate
and theoretically explain the emergence of five distinct phenomena reminiscent
of cognitive functions: (i) learning the structure of a chaotic system purely
from time series, (ii) generating new streams of stimuli from a chaotic system,
(iii) switching stream generation among multiple learned chaotic systems,
either spontaneously or in response to external perturbations, (iv) inferring
missing data from sparse observations of the chaotic system, and (v)
deciphering superimposed input from different chaotic systems. Numerically, we
show that these phenomena emerge naturally from a recurrent neural network of
Erdos-Renyi topology in which the synaptic strengths adapt in a Hebbian-like
manner. Broadly, our work blends chaotic theory and artificial neural networks
to answer the long standing question of how neural systems can learn the
structure underlying temporal sequences of stimuli.

"  Rapid changes in extracellular osmolarity are one of many insults microbial
cells face on a daily basis. To protect against such shocks, Escherichia coli
and other microbes express several types of transmembrane channels which open
and close in response to changes in membrane tension. In E. coli, one of the
most abundant channels is the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance
(MscL). While this channel has been heavily characterized through structural
methods, electrophysiology, and theoretical modeling, our understanding of its
physiological role in preventing cell death by alleviating high membrane
tension remains tenuous. In this work, we examine the contribution of MscL
alone to cell survival after osmotic shock at single cell resolution using
quantitative fluorescence microscopy. We conduct these experiments in an E.
coli strain which is lacking all mechanosensitive channel genes save for MscL
whose expression is tuned across three orders of magnitude through
modifications of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. While theoretical models suggest
that only a few MscL channels would be needed to alleviate even large changes
in osmotic pressure, we find that between 500 and 700 channels per cell are
needed to convey upwards of 80% survival. This number agrees with the average
MscL copy number measured in wild-type E. coli cells through proteomic studies
and quantitative Western blotting. Furthermore, we observe zero survival events
in cells with less than 100 channels per cell. This work opens new questions
concerning the contribution of other mechanosensitive channels to survival as
well as regulation of their activity.
"
"  The actin cytoskeleton is an active semi-flexible polymer network whose
non-equilibrium properties coordinate both stable and contractile behaviors to
maintain or change cell shape. While myosin motors drive the actin cytoskeleton
out-of-equilibrium, the role of myosin-driven active stresses in the
accumulation and dissipation of mechanical energy is unclear. To investigate
this, we synthesize an actomyosin material in vitro whose active stress content
can tune the network from stable to contractile. Each increment in activity
determines a characteristic spectrum of actin filament fluctuations which is
used to calculate the total mechanical work and the production of entropy in
the material. We find that the balance of work and entropy does not increase
monotonically and, surprisingly, the entropy production rate is maximized in
the non-contractile, stable state. Our study provides evidence that the origins
of system entropy production and activity-dependent dissipation arise from
disorder in the molecular interactions between actin and myosin
"
"  Determining the relative importance of environmental factors, biotic
interactions and stochasticity in assembling and maintaining species-rich
communities remains a major challenge in ecology. In plant communities,
interactions between individuals of different species are expected to leave a
spatial signature in the form of positive or negative spatial correlations over
distances relating to the spatial scale of interaction. Most studies using
spatial point process tools have found relatively little evidence for
interactions between pairs of species. More interactions tend to be detected in
communities with fewer species. However, there is currently no understanding of
how the power to detect spatial interactions may change with sample size, or
the scale and intensity of interactions.
We use a simple 2-species model where the scale and intensity of interactions
are controlled to simulate point pattern data. In combination with an
approximation to the variance of the spatial summary statistics that we sample,
we investigate the power of current spatial point pattern methods to correctly
reject the null model of bivariate species independence.
We show that the power to detect interactions is positively related to the
abundances of the species tested, and the intensity and scale of interactions.
Increasing imbalance in abundances has a negative effect on the power to detect
interactions. At population sizes typically found in currently available
datasets for species-rich plant communities we find only a very low power to
detect interactions. Differences in power may explain the increased frequency
of interactions in communities with fewer species. Furthermore, the
community-wide frequency of detected interactions is very sensitive to a
minimum abundance criterion for including species in the analyses.

"  Direct cDNA preamplification protocols developed for single-cell RNA-seq
(scRNA-seq) have enabled transcriptome profiling of rare cells without having
to pool multiple samples or to perform RNA extraction. We term this approach
limiting-cell RNA-seq (lcRNA-seq). Unlike scRNA-seq, which focuses on
'cell-atlasing', lcRNA-seq focuses on identifying differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) between experimental groups. This requires accounting for systems
noise which can obscure biological differences. We present CLEAR, a workflow
that identifies robust transcripts in lcRNA-seq data for between-group
comparisons. To develop CLEAR, we compared DEGs from RNA extracted from
FACS-derived CD5+ and CD5- cells from a single chronic lymphocytic leukemia
patient diluted to input RNA levels of 10-, 100- and 1,000pg. Data quality at
ultralow input levels are known to be noisy. When using CLEAR transcripts vs.
using all available transcripts, downstream analyses reveal more shared DEGs,
improved Principal Component Analysis separation of cell type, and increased
similarity between results across different input RNA amounts. CLEAR was
applied to two publicly available ultralow input RNA-seq data and an in-house
murine neural cell lcRNA-seq dataset. CLEAR provides a novel way to visualize
the public datasets while validates cell phenotype markers for astrocytes,
neural stem and progenitor cells.

"  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia with
accelerated and irregular heart rate (HR), leading to both heart failure and
stroke and being responsible for an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. In spite of its importance, the direct effects of AF on the arterial
hemodynamic patterns are not completely known to date. Based on a multiscale
modelling approach, the proposed work investigates the effects of AF on the
local arterial fluid dynamics. AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) conditions are
simulated extracting 2000 $\mathrm{RR}$ heartbeats and comparing the most
relevant cardiac and vascular parameters at the same HR (75 bpm). Present
outcomes evidence that the arterial system is not able to completely absorb the
AF-induced variability, which can be even amplified towards the peripheral
circulation. AF is also able to locally alter the wave dynamics, by modifying
the interplay between forward and backward signals. The sole heart rhythm
variation (i.e., from NSR to AF) promotes an alteration of the regular dynamics
at the arterial level which, in terms of pressure and peripheral perfusion,
suggests a modification of the physiological phenomena ruled by periodicity
(e.g., regular organ perfusion)and a possible vascular dysfunction due to the
prolonged exposure to irregular and extreme values. The present study
represents a first modeling approach to characterize the variability of
arterial hemodynamics in presence of AF, which surely deserves further clinical
investigation.

"  1. Theoretical models pertaining to feedbacks between ecological and
evolutionary processes are prevalent in multiple biological fields. An
integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the
fields and the use of different methodological approaches.
2. Here we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and
highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur
both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including
populations, communities, and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks
across spatial scales.
3. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying
assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of
eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled
by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of
these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues.
4. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been
incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not
always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and
evolutionary time scales. We discuss the importance of density- and
frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of
dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial
context.

"  Continuous attractors have been used to understand recent neuroscience
experiments where persistent activity patterns encode internal representations
of external attributes like head direction or spatial location. However, the
conditions under which the emergent bump of neural activity in such networks
can be manipulated by space and time-dependent external sensory or motor
signals are not understood. Here, we find fundamental limits on how rapidly
internal representations encoded along continuous attractors can be updated by
an external signal. We apply these results to place cell networks to derive a
velocity-dependent non-equilibrium memory capacity in neural networks.
"
"  How individuals adapt their behavior in cultural evolution remains elusive.
Theoretical studies have shown that the update rules chosen to model individual
decision making can dramatically modify the evolutionary outcome of the
population as a whole. This hints at the complexities of considering the
personality of individuals in a population, where each one uses its own rule.
Here, we investigate whether and how heterogeneity in the rules of behavior
update alters the evolutionary outcome. We assume that individuals update
behaviors by aspiration-based self-evaluation and they do so in their own ways.
Under weak selection, we analytically reveal a simple property that holds for
any two-strategy multi-player games in well-mixed populations and on regular
graphs: the evolutionary outcome in a population with heterogeneous update
rules is the weighted average of the outcomes in the corresponding homogeneous
populations, and the associated weights are the frequencies of each update rule
in the heterogeneous population. Beyond weak selection, we show that this
property holds for public goods games. Our finding implies that heterogeneous
aspiration dynamics is additive. This additivity greatly reduces the complexity
induced by the underlying individual heterogeneity. Our work thus provides an
efficient method to calculate evolutionary outcomes under heterogeneous update
rules.

"  Music, being a multifaceted stimulus evolving at multiple timescales,
modulates brain function in a manifold way that encompasses not only the
distinct stages of auditory perception but also higher cognitive processes like
memory and appraisal. Network theory is apparently a promising approach to
describe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during
music listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined
within the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Using naturalistic
music, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with
different cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface EEG
measurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to
quantify the interplay among rhythms. It was also contrasted against the
structure from the rest and noise listening conditions to reveal the specific
components stemming from music listening. Our methodology includes an efficient
graph-partitioning algorithm, which is further utilized for mining prototypical
modular patterns, and a novel algorithmic procedure for identifying switching
nodes that consistently change module during music listening. Our results
suggest the multiplex character of the music-induced functional reorganization
and particularly indicate the dependence between the networks reconstructed
from the {\delta} and {\beta}H rhythms. This dependence is further justified
within the framework of nested neural oscillations and fits perfectly within
the context of recently introduced cortical entrainment to music. Considering
its computational efficiency, and in conjunction with the flexibility of in
situ electroencephalography, it may lead to novel assistive tools for real-life
applications.

"  Extreme deformations of the DNA double helix attracted a lot of attention
during the past decades. Particularly, the determination of the persistence
length of DNA with extreme local disruptions, or kinks, has become a crucial
problem in the studies of many important biological processes. In this paper we
review an approach to calculate the persistence length of the double helix by
taking into account the formation of kinks of arbitrary configuration. The
reviewed approach improves the Kratky--Porod model to determine the type and
nature of kinks that occur in the double helix, by measuring a reduction of the
persistence length of the kinkable DNA.

"  Parental gametes unite to form a zygote that develops into an adult with
gonads that, in turn, produce gametes. Interruption of this germinal cycle by
prezygotic or postzygotic reproductive barriers can result in two independent
cycles, each with the potential to evolve into a new species. When the
speciation process is complete, members of each species are fully
reproductively isolated from those of the other. During speciation a primary
barrier may be supported and eventually superceded by a later appearing
secondary barrier. For those holding certain cases of prezygotic isolation to
be primary (e.g. elephant cannot copulate with mouse), the onus is to show that
they had not been preceded over evolutionary time by periods of postzygotic
hybrid inviability (genically determined) or sterility (genically or
chromosomally determined). Likewise, the onus is upon those holding cases of
hybrid inviability to be primary (e.g. Dobzhansky-Muller epistatic
incompatibilities), to show that they had not been preceded by periods, however
brief, of hybrid sterility. The latter, when acting as a sympatric barrier
causing reproductive isolation, can only be primary. In many cases, hybrid
sterility may result from incompatibilities between parental chromosomes that
attempt to pair during meiosis in the gonad of their offspring
(Winge-Crowther-Bateson incompatibilities). While WCB incompatibilities have
long been observed on a microscopic scale, there is growing evidence for a role
of dispersed finer DNA sequence differences.

"  We study the effect of contingent movement on the persistence of cooperation
on complex networks with empty nodes. Each agent plays Prisoner's Dilemma game
with its neighbors and then it either updates the strategy depending on the
payoff difference with neighbors or it moves to another empty node if not
satisfied with its own payoff. If no neighboring node is empty, each agent
stays at the same site. By extensive evolutionary simulations, we show that the
medium density of agents enhances cooperation where the network flow of mobile
agents is also medium. Moreover, if the movements of agents are more frequent
than the strategy updating, cooperation is further promoted. In scale-free
networks, the optimal density for cooperation is lower than other networks
because agents get stuck at hubs. Our study suggests that keeping a smooth
network flow is significant for the persistence of cooperation in ever-changing
societies.

"  While students may find spline interpolation easily digestible, based on
their familiarity with continuity of a function and its derivatives, some of
its inherent value may be missed when students only see it applied to standard
data interpolation exercises. In this paper, we offer alternatives where
students can qualitatively and quantitatively witness the resulting dynamical
differences when objects are driven through a fluid using different spline
interpolation methods. They say, seeing is believing; here we showcase the
differences between linear and cubic spline interpolation using examples from
fluid pumping and aquatic locomotion. Moreover, students can define their own
interpolation functions and visualize the dynamics unfold. To solve the
fluid-structure interaction system, the open source software IB2d is used. In
that vein, all simulation codes, analysis scripts, and movies are provided for
streamlined use.

"  Quantifying and estimating wildlife population sizes is a foundation of
wildlife management. However, many carnivore species are cryptic, leading to
innate difficulties in estimating their populations. We evaluated the potential
for using more rigorous statistical models to estimate the populations of black
bears (Ursus americanus) in Wisconisin, and their applicability to other
furbearers such as bobcats (Lynx rufus). To estimate black bear populations, we
developed an AAH state-space model in a Bayesian framework based on Norton
(2015) that can account for variation in harvest and population demographics
over time. Our state-space model created an accurate estimate of the black bear
population in Wisconsin based on age-at-harvest data and improves on previous
models by using little demographic data, no auxiliary data, and not being
sensitive to initial population size. The increased accuracy of the AAH
state-space models should allow for better management by being able to set
accurate quotas to ensure a sustainable harvest for the black bear population
in each zone. We also evaluated the demography and annual harvest data of
bobcats in Wisconsin to determine trends in harvest, method, and hunter
participation in Wisconsin. Each trait of harvested bobcats that we tested
(mass, male:female sex ratio, and age) changed over time, and because these
were interrelated, and we inferred that harvest selection for larger size
biased harvests in favor of a) larger, b) older, and c) male bobcats by hound
hunters. We also found an increase in the proportion of bobcats that were
harvested by hound hunting compared to trapping, and that hound hunters were
more likely to create taxidermy mounts than trappers. We also found that
decreasing available bobcat tags and increasing success have occurred over
time, and correlate with substantially increasing both hunter populations and
hunter interest.

"  Transcriptional repressor CTCF is an important regulator of chromatin 3D
structure, facilitating the formation of topologically associating domains
(TADs). However, its direct effects on gene regulation is less well understood.
Here, we utilize previously published ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to investigate
the effects of CTCF on alternative splicing of genes with CTCF sites. We
compared the amount of RNA-seq signals in exons upstream and downstream of
binding sites following auxin-induced degradation of CTCF in mouse embryonic
stem cells. We found that changes in gene expression following CTCF depletion
were significant, with a general increase in the presence of upstream exons. We
infer that a possible mechanism by which CTCF binding contributes to
alternative splicing is by causing pauses in the transcription mechanism during
which splicing elements are able to concurrently act on upstream exons already
transcribed into RNA.

"  Threshold theorem is probably the most important development of mathematical
epidemic modelling. Unfortunately, some models may not behave according to the
threshold. In this paper, we will focus on the final outcome of SIR model with
demography. The behaviour of the model approached by deteministic and
stochastic models will be introduced, mainly using simulations. Furthermore, we
will also investigate the dynamic of susceptibles in population in absence of
infective. We have successfully showed that both deterministic and stochastic
models performed similar results when $R_0 \leq 1$. That is, the disease-free
stage in the epidemic. But when $R_0 > 1$, the deterministic and stochastic
approaches had different interpretations.

"  Repeated exposure to low-level blast may initiate a range of adverse health
problem such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although many studies
successfully identified genes associated with TBI, yet the cellular mechanisms
underpinning TBI are not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated
underlying relationship among genes through constructing transcript Bayesian
networks using RNA-seq data. The data for pre- and post-blast transcripts,
which were collected on 33 individuals in Army training program, combined with
our system approach provide unique opportunity to investigate the effect of
blast-wave exposure on gene-gene interactions. Digging into the networks, we
identified four subnetworks related to immune system and inflammatory process
that are disrupted due to the exposure. Among genes with relatively high fold
change in their transcript expression level, ATP6V1G1, B2M, BCL2A1, PELI,
S100A8, TRIM58 and ZNF654 showed major impact on the dysregulation of the
gene-gene interactions. This study reveals how repeated exposures to traumatic
conditions increase the level of fold change of transcript expression and
hypothesizes new targets for further experimental studies.

"  Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) play
essential roles in animal reproduction. They exert their function through
binding to their cognate receptors, which belong to the large family of G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This recognition at the plasma membrane
triggers a plethora of cellular events, whose processing and integration
ultimately lead to an adapted biological response. Understanding the nature and
the kinetics of these events is essential for innovative approaches in drug
discovery. The study and manipulation of such complex systems requires the use
of computational modeling approaches combined with robust in vitro functional
assays for calibration and validation. Modeling brings a detailed understanding
of the system and can also be used to understand why existing drugs do not work
as well as expected, and how to design more efficient ones.

"  Despite the widely-spread consensus on the brain complexity, sprouts of the
single neuron revolution emerged in neuroscience in the 1970s. They brought
many unexpected discoveries, including grandmother or concept cells and sparse
coding of information in the brain.
In machine learning for a long time, the famous curse of dimensionality
seemed to be an unsolvable problem. Nevertheless, the idea of the blessing of
dimensionality becomes gradually more and more popular. Ensembles of
non-interacting or weakly interacting simple units prove to be an effective
tool for solving essentially multidimensional problems. This approach is
especially useful for one-shot (non-iterative) correction of errors in large
legacy artificial intelligence systems.
These simplicity revolutions in the era of complexity have deep fundamental
reasons grounded in geometry of multidimensional data spaces. To explore and
understand these reasons we revisit the background ideas of statistical
physics. In the course of the 20th century they were developed into the
concentration of measure theory. New stochastic separation theorems reveal the
fine structure of the data clouds.
We review and analyse biological, physical, and mathematical problems at the
core of the fundamental question: how can high-dimensional brain organise
reliable and fast learning in high-dimensional world of data by simple tools?
Two critical applications are reviewed to exemplify the approach: one-shot
correction of errors in intellectual systems and emergence of static and
associative memories in ensembles of single neurons.
"
"  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations cause severe congenital diseases but may
also be associated with healthy aging. MtDNA is stochastically replicated and
degraded, and exists within organelles which undergo dynamic fusion and
fission. The role of the resulting mitochondrial networks in determining the
time evolution of the cellular proportion of mutated mtDNA molecules
(heteroplasmy), and cell-to-cell variability in heteroplasmy (heteroplasmy
variance), remains incompletely understood. Heteroplasmy variance is
particularly important since it modulates the number of pathological cells in a
tissue. Here, we provide the first wide-reaching mathematical treatment which
bridges mitochondrial network and genetic states. We show that, for a range of
models, the rate of increase in heteroplasmy variance, and the rate of
\textit{de novo} mutation, is proportionately modulated by the fraction of
unfused mitochondria, independently of the absolute fission-fusion rate. In the
context of selective fusion, we show that intermediate fusion/fission ratios
are optimal for the clearance of mtDNA mutants. Our findings imply that
modulating network state, mitophagy rate and copy number to slow down
heteroplasmy dynamics when mean heteroplasmy is low, could have therapeutic
advantages for mitochondrial disease and healthy aging.
"
"  We built a two-state model of an asexually reproducing organism in a periodic
environment endowed with the capability to anticipate an upcoming environmental
change and undergo pre-emptive switching. By virtue of these anticipatory
transitions, the organism oscillates between its two states that is a time
$\theta$ out of sync with the environmental oscillation. We show that an
anticipation-capable organism increases its long-term fitness over an organism
that oscillates in-sync with the environment, provided $\theta$ does not exceed
a threshold. We also show that the long-term fitness is maximized for an
optimal anticipation time that decreases approximately as $1/n$, $n$ being the
number of cell divisions in time $T$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimal
""anticipators"" outperforms ""bet-hedgers"" in the range of parameters considered.
For a sub-optimal ensemble of anticipators, anticipation performs better to
bet-hedging only when the variance in anticipation is small compared to the
mean and the rate of pre-emptive transition is high. Taken together, our work
suggests that anticipation increases overall fitness of an organism in a
periodic environment and it is a viable alternative to bet-hedging provided the
error in anticipation is small.
"
"  All known life forms are based upon a hierarchy of interwoven feedback loops,
operating over a cascade of space, time and energy scales. Among the most basic
loops are those connecting DNA and proteins. For example, in genetic networks,
DNA genes are expressed as proteins, which may bind near the same genes and
thereby control their own expression. In this molecular type of self-reference,
information is mapped from the DNA sequence to the protein and back to DNA.
There is a variety of dynamic DNA-protein self-reference loops, and the purpose
of this remark is to discuss certain geometrical and physical aspects related
to the back and forth mapping between DNA and proteins. The discussion raises
basic questions regarding the nature of DNA and proteins as self-referring
matter, which are examined in a simple toy model.
"
"  Response delay is an inherent and essential part of human actions. In the
context of human balance control, the response delay is traditionally modeled
using the formalism of delay-differential equations, which adopts the
approximation of fixed delay. However, experimental studies revealing
substantial variability, adaptive anticipation, and non-stationary dynamics of
response delay provide evidence against this approximation. In this paper, we
call for development of principally new mathematical formalism describing human
response delay. To support this, we present the experimental data from a simple
virtual stick balancing task. Our results demonstrate that human response delay
is a widely distributed random variable with complex properties, which can
exhibit oscillatory and adaptive dynamics characterized by long-range
correlations. Given this, we argue that the fixed-delay approximation ignores
essential properties of human response, and conclude with possible directions
for future developments of new mathematical notions describing human control.
"
"  The permutation test is known as the exact test procedure in statistics.
However, often it is not exact in practice and only an approximate method since
only a small fraction of every possible permutation is generated. Even for a
small sample size, it often requires to generate tens of thousands
permutations, which can be a serious computational bottleneck. In this paper,
we propose a novel combinatorial inference procedure that enumerates all
possible permutations combinatorially without any resampling. The proposed
method is validated against the standard permutation test in simulation studies
with the ground truth. The method is further applied in twin DTI study in
determining the genetic contribution of the minimum spanning tree of the
structural brain connectivity.
"
"  Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are neural oscillations from
the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that are evoked from flickering
visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the
electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require
hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus
signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their
relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when
SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail. In
this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN),
which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be
used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for any
domain-specific knowledge or calibration data. We report across subject mean
accuracy of approximately 80% (chance being 8.3%) and show this is
substantially better than current state-of-the-art hand-crafted approaches
using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, we
analyze our Compact-CNN to examine the underlying feature representation,
discovering that the deep learner extracts additional phase and amplitude
related features associated with the structure of the dataset. We discuss how
our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely
gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g., asynchronous BCI) as well as
provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our
understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.
"
"  Autoreactive B cells have a central role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), and recent findings have proposed that anti-citrullinated
protein autoantibodies (ACPA) may be directly pathogenic. Herein, we
demonstrate the frequency of variable-region glycosylation in single-cell
cloned mAbs. A total of 14 ACPA mAbs were evaluated for predicted N-linked
glycosylation motifs in silico and compared to 452 highly-mutated mAbs from RA
patients and controls. Variable region N-linked motifs (N-X-S/T) were
strikingly prevalent within ACPA (100%) compared to somatically hypermutated
(SHM) RA bone marrow plasma cells (21%), and synovial plasma cells from
seropositive (39%) and seronegative RA (7%). When normalized for SHM, ACPA
still had significantly higher frequency of N-linked motifs compared to all
studied mAbs including highly-mutated HIV broadly-neutralizing and
malaria-associated mAbs. The Fab glycans of ACPA-mAbs were highly sialylated,
contributed to altered charge, but did not influence antigen binding. The
analysis revealed evidence of unusual B-cell selection pressure and
SHM-mediated decreased in surface charge and isoelectric point in ACPA. It is
still unknown how these distinct features of anti-citrulline immunity may have
an impact on pathogenesis. However, it is evident that they offer selective
advantages for ACPA+ B cells, possibly also through non-antigen driven
mechanisms.
"
"  We study a deterministic version of a one- and two-dimensional attractor
neural network model of hippocampal activity first studied by Itskov et al
2011. We analyze the dynamics of the system on the ring and torus domain with
an even periodized weight matrix, assum- ing weak and slow spike frequency
adaptation and a weak stationary input current. On these domains, we find
transitions from spatially localized stationary solutions (""bumps"") to
(periodically modulated) solutions (""sloshers""), as well as constant and
non-constant velocity traveling bumps depending on the relative strength of
external input current and adaptation. The weak and slow adaptation allows for
a reduction of the system from a distributed partial integro-differential
equation to a system of scalar Volterra integro-differential equations
describing the movement of the centroid of the bump solution. Using this
reduction, we show that on both domains, sloshing solutions arise through an
Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and derive a normal form for the Hopf bifurcation on
the ring. We also show existence and stability of constant velocity solutions
on both domains using Evans functions. In contrast to existing studies, we
assume a general weight matrix of Mexican-hat type in addition to a smooth
firing rate function.
"
"  The goal of this dissertation is to study the sequence polymorphism in
retrotransposable elements of Entamoeba histolytica. The Quasispecies theory, a
concept of equilibrium (stationary), has been used to understand the behaviour
of these elements. Two datasets of retrotransposons of Entamoeba histolytica
have been used. We present results from both datasets of retrotransposons
(SINE1s) of E. histolytica. We have calculated the mutation rate of EhSINE1s
for both datasets and drawn a phylogenetic tree for newly determined EhSINE1s
(dataset II). We have also discussed the variation in lengths of EhSINE1s for
both datasets. Using the quasispecies model, we have shown how sequences of
SINE1s vary within the population. The outputs of the quasispecies model are
discussed in the presence and the absence of back mutation by taking different
values of fitness. From our study of Non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons
(LINEs and their non-autonomous partner's SINEs) of Entamoeba histolytica, we
can conclude that an active EhSINE can generate very similar copies of itself
by retrotransposition. Due to this reason, it increases mutations which give
the result of sequence polymorphism. We have concluded that the mutation rate
of SINE is very high. This high mutation rate provides an idea for the
existence of SINEs, which may affect the genetic analysis of EhSINE1
ancestries, and calculation of phylogenetic distances.

"  To understand the biology of cancer, joint analysis of multiple data
modalities, including imaging and genomics, is crucial. The involved nature of
gene-microenvironment interactions necessitates the use of algorithms which
treat both data types equally. We propose the use of canonical correlation
analysis (CCA) and a sparse variant as a preliminary discovery tool for
identifying connections across modalities, specifically between gene expression
and features describing cell and nucleus shape, texture, and stain intensity in
histopathological images. Applied to 615 breast cancer samples from The Cancer
Genome Atlas, CCA revealed significant correlation of several image features
with expression of PAM50 genes, known to be linked to outcome, while Sparse CCA
revealed associations with enrichment of pathways implicated in cancer without
leveraging prior biological understanding. These findings affirm the utility of
CCA for joint phenotype-genotype analysis of cancer.
"
"  Power-law-distributed species counts or clone counts arise in many biological
settings such as multispecies cell populations, population genetics, and
ecology. This empirical observation that the number of species $c_{k}$
represented by $k$ individuals scales as negative powers of $k$ is also
supported by a series of theoretical birth-death-immigration (BDI) models that
consistently predict many low-population species, a few intermediate-population
species, and very high-population species. However, we show how a simple global
population-dependent regulation in a neutral BDI model destroys the power law
distributions. Simulation of the regulated BDI model shows a high probability
of observing a high-population species that dominates the total population.
Further analysis reveals that the origin of this breakdown is associated with
the failure of a mean-field approximation for the expected species abundance
distribution. We find an accurate estimate for the expected distribution
$\langle c_k \rangle$ by mapping the problem to a lower-dimensional Moran
process, allowing us to also straightforwardly calculate the covariances
$\langle c_k c_\ell \rangle$. Finally, we exploit the concepts associated with
energy landscapes to explain the failure of the mean-field assumption by
identifying a phase transition in the quasi-steady-state species counts
triggered by a decreasing immigration rate.
"
"  In the last decades, dispersal studies have benefitted from the use of
molecular markers for detecting patterns differing between categories of
individuals, and have highlighted sex-biased dispersal in several species. To
explain this phenomenon, sex-related handicaps such as parental care have been
recently proposed as a hypothesis. Herein we tested this hypothesis in
Armadillidium vulgare, a terrestrial isopod in which females bear the totality
of the high parental care costs. We performed a fine-scale analysis of
sex-specific dispersal patterns, using males and females originating from five
sampling points located within 70 meters of each other. Based on microsatellite
markers and both F-statistics and spatial autocorrelation analyses, our results
revealed that while males did not present a significant structure at this
geographic scale, females were significantly more similar to each other when
they were collected in the same sampling point. These results support the
sex-handicap hypothesis, and we suggest that widening dispersal studies to
other isopods or crustaceans, displaying varying levels of parental care but
differing in their ecology or mating system, might shed light on the processes
underlying the evolution of sex-biased dispersal.
"
"  The muscle synergy concept provides a widely-accepted paradigm to break down
the complexity of motor control. In order to identify the synergies, different
matrix factorisation techniques have been used in a repertoire of fields such
as prosthesis control and biomechanical and clinical studies. However, the
relevance of these matrix factorisation techniques is still open for discussion
since there is no ground truth for the underlying synergies. Here, we evaluate
factorisation techniques and investigate the factors that affect the quality of
estimated synergies. We compared commonly used matrix factorisation methods:
Principal component analysis (PCA), Independent component analysis (ICA),
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and second-order blind identification
(SOBI). Publicly available real data were used to assess the synergies
extracted by each factorisation method in the classification of wrist
movements. Synthetic datasets were utilised to explore the effect of muscle
synergy sparsity, level of noise and number of channels on the extracted
synergies. Results suggest that the sparse synergy model and a higher number of
channels would result in better-estimated synergies. Without dimensionality
reduction, SOBI showed better results than other factorisation methods. This
suggests that SOBI would be an alternative when a limited number of electrodes
is available but its performance was still poor in that case. Otherwise, NMF
had the best performance when the number of channels was higher than the number
of synergies. Therefore, NMF would be the best method for muscle synergy
extraction.

"  Immunotherapy plays a major role in tumour treatment, in comparison with
other methods of dealing with cancer. The Kirschner-Panetta (KP) model of
cancer immunotherapy describes the interaction between tumour cells, effector
cells and interleukin-2 which are clinically utilized as medical treatment. The
model selects a rich concept of immune-tumour dynamics. In this paper,
approximate analytical solutions to KP model are represented by using the
differential transform and Adomian decomposition. The complicated nonlinearity
of the KP system causes the application of these two methods to require more
involved calculations. The approximate analytical solutions to the model are
compared with the results obtained by numerical fourth order Runge-Kutta
method.

"  Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are popular time series model in many fields
including ecology, economics and genetics. HMMs can be defined over discrete or
continuous time, though here we only cover the former. In the field of movement
ecology in particular, HMMs have become a popular tool for the analysis of
movement data because of their ability to connect observed movement data to an
underlying latent process, generally interpreted as the animal's unobserved
behavior. Further, we model the tendency to persist in a given behavior over
time. Notation presented here will generally follow the format of Zucchini et
al. (2016) and cover HMMs applied in an unsupervised case to animal movement
data, specifically positional data. We provide Stan code to analyze movement
data of the wild haggis as presented first in Michelot et al. (2016).

"  Microorganisms, such as bacteria, are one of the first targets of
nanoparticles in the environment. In this study, we tested the effect of two
nanoparticles, ZnO and TiO2, with the salt ZnSO4 as the control, on the
Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis by 2D gel electrophoresis-based
proteomics. Despite a significant effect on viability (LD50), TiO2 NPs had no
detectable effect on the proteomic pattern, while ZnO NPs and ZnSO4
significantly modified B. subtilis metabolism. These results allowed us to
conclude that the effects of ZnO observed in this work were mainly attributable
to Zn dissolution in the culture media. Proteomic analysis highlighted twelve
modulated proteins related to central metabolism: MetE and MccB (cysteine
metabolism), OdhA, AspB, IolD, AnsB, PdhB and YtsJ (Krebs cycle) and XylA,
YqjI, Drm and Tal (pentose phosphate pathway). Biochemical assays, such as free
sulfhydryl, CoA-SH and malate dehydrogenase assays corroborated the observed
central metabolism reorientation and showed that Zn stress induced oxidative
stress, probably as a consequence of thiol chelation stress by Zn ions. The
other patterns affected by ZnO and ZnSO4 were the stringent response and the
general stress response. Nine proteins involved in or controlled by the
stringent response showed a modified expression profile in the presence of ZnO
NPs or ZnSO4: YwaC, SigH, YtxH, YtzB, TufA, RplJ, RpsB, PdhB and Mbl. An
increase in the ppGpp concentration confirmed the involvement of the stringent
response during a Zn stress. All these metabolic reorientations in response to
Zn stress were probably the result of complex regulatory mechanisms including
at least the stringent response via YwaC.
"
"  Segmental duplications (SDs), or low-copy repeats (LCR), are segments of DNA
greater than 1 Kbp with high sequence identity that are copied to other regions
of the genome. SDs are among the most important sources of evolution, a common
cause of genomic structural variation, and several are associated with diseases
of genomic origin. Despite their functional importance, SDs present one of the
major hurdles for de novo genome assembly due to the ambiguity they cause in
building and traversing both state-of-the-art overlap-layout-consensus and de
Bruijn graphs. This causes SD regions to be misassembled, collapsed into a
unique representation, or completely missing from assembled reference genomes
for various organisms. In turn, this missing or incorrect information limits
our ability to fully understand the evolution and the architecture of the
genomes. Despite the essential need to accurately characterize SDs in
assemblies, there is only one tool that has been developed for this purpose,
called Whole Genome Assembly Comparison (WGAC). WGAC is comprised of several
steps that employ different tools and custom scripts, which makes it difficult
and time consuming to use. Thus there is still a need for algorithms to
characterize within-assembly SDs quickly, accurately, and in a user friendly
manner.
Here we introduce a SEgmental Duplication Evaluation Framework (SEDEF) to
rapidly detect SDs through sophisticated filtering strategies based on Jaccard
similarity and local chaining. We show that SEDEF accurately detects SDs while
maintaining substantial speed up over WGAC that translates into practical run
times of minutes instead of weeks. Notably, our algorithm captures up to 25%
pairwise error between segments, where previous studies focused on only 10%,
allowing us to more deeply track the evolutionary history of the genome.
SEDEF is available at this https URL

"  In this paper, we propose a sex-structured entomological model that serves as
a basis for design of control strategies relying on releases of sterile male
mosquitoes (Aedes spp) and aiming at elimination of the wild vector population
in some target locality. We consider different types of releases (constant and
periodic impulsive), providing necessary conditions to reach elimination.
However, the main part of the paper is focused on the study of the periodic
impulsive control in different situations. When the size of wild mosquito
population cannot be assessed in real time, we propose the so-called open-loop
control strategy that relies on periodic impulsive releases of sterile males
with constant release size. Under this control mode, global convergence towards
the mosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of sufficient condition
that relates the size and frequency of releases. If periodic assessments
(either synchronized with releases or more sparse) of the wild population size
are available in real time, we propose the so-called closed-loop control
strategy, which is adjustable in accordance with reliable estimations of the
wild population sizes. Under this control mode, global convergence to the
mosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of another sufficient
condition that relates not only the size and frequency of periodic releases but
also the frequency of sparse measurements taken on wild populations. Finally,
we propose a mixed control strategy that combines open-loop and closed-loop
strategies. This control mode renders the best result, in terms of overall time
needed to reach elimination and the number of releases to be effectively
carried out during the whole release campaign, while requiring for a reasonable
amount of released sterile insects.

"  Data-driven spatial filtering algorithms optimize scores such as the contrast
between two conditions to extract oscillatory brain signal components. Most
machine learning approaches for filter estimation, however, disregard
within-trial temporal dynamics and are extremely sensitive to changes in
training data and involved hyperparameters. This leads to highly variable
solutions and impedes the selection of a suitable candidate for,
e.g.,~neurotechnological applications. Fostering component introspection, we
propose to embrace this variability by condensing the functional signatures of
a large set of oscillatory components into homogeneous clusters, each
representing specific within-trial envelope dynamics.
The proposed method is exemplified by and evaluated on a complex hand force
task with a rich within-trial structure. Based on electroencephalography data
of 18 healthy subjects, we found that the components' distinct temporal
envelope dynamics are highly subject-specific. On average, we obtained seven
clusters per subject, which were strictly confined regarding their underlying
frequency bands. As the analysis method is not limited to a specific spatial
filtering algorithm, it could be utilized for a wide range of
neurotechnological applications, e.g., to select and monitor functionally
relevant features for brain-computer interface protocols in stroke
rehabilitation.

"  We present a novel approach for the prediction of anticancer compound
sensitivity by means of multi-modal attention-based neural networks (PaccMann).
In our approach, we integrate three key pillars of drug sensitivity, namely,
the molecular structure of compounds, transcriptomic profiles of cancer cells
as well as prior knowledge about interactions among proteins within cells. Our
models ingest a drug-cell pair consisting of SMILES encoding of a compound and
the gene expression profile of a cancer cell and predicts an IC50 sensitivity
value. Gene expression profiles are encoded using an attention-based encoding
mechanism that assigns high weights to the most informative genes. We present
and study three encoders for SMILES string of compounds: 1) bidirectional
recurrent 2) convolutional 3) attention-based encoders. We compare our devised
models against a baseline model that ingests engineered fingerprints to
represent the molecular structure. We demonstrate that using our
attention-based encoders, we can surpass the baseline model. The use of
attention-based encoders enhance interpretability and enable us to identify
genes, bonds and atoms that were used by the network to make a prediction.

"  Often, large, high dimensional datasets collected across multiple modalities
can be organized as a higher order tensor. Low-rank tensor decomposition then
arises as a powerful and widely used tool to discover simple low dimensional
structures underlying such data. However, we currently lack a theoretical
understanding of the algorithmic behavior of low-rank tensor decompositions. We
derive Bayesian approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms for recovering
arbitrarily shaped low-rank tensors buried within noise, and we employ dynamic
mean field theory to precisely characterize their performance. Our theory
reveals the existence of phase transitions between easy, hard and impossible
inference regimes, and displays an excellent match with simulations. Moreover,
it reveals several qualitative surprises compared to the behavior of symmetric,
cubic tensor decomposition. Finally, we compare our AMP algorithm to the most
commonly used algorithm, alternating least squares (ALS), and demonstrate that
AMP significantly outperforms ALS in the presence of noise.

"  We present a computational method to evaluate the end-to-end and the contour
length distribution functions of short DNA molecules described by a mesoscopic
Hamiltonian. The method generates a large statistical ensemble of possible
configurations for each dimer in the sequence, selects the global equilibrium
twist conformation for the molecule and determines the average base pair
distances along the molecule backbone. Integrating over the base pair radial
and angular fluctuations, we derive the room temperature distribution functions
as a function of the sequence length. The obtained values for the most probable
end-to-end distance and contour length distance, providing a measure of the
global molecule size, are used to examine the DNA flexibility at short length
scales. It is found that, also in molecules with less than $\sim 60$ base
pairs, coiled configurations maintain a large statistical weight and,
consistently, the persistence lengths may be much smaller than in kilo-base
DNA.

"  In this paper we introduce a new mathematical model for the active
contraction of cardiac muscle, featuring different thermo-electric and
nonlinear conductivity properties. The passive hyperelastic response of the
tissue is described by an orthotropic exponential model, whereas the ionic
activity dictates active contraction incorporated through the concept of
orthotropic active strain. We use a fully incompressible formulation, and the
generated strain modifies directly the conductivity mechanisms in the medium
through the pull-back transformation. We also investigate the influence of
thermo-electric effects in the onset of multiphysics emergent spatiotemporal
dynamics, using nonlinear diffusion. It turns out that these ingredients have a
key role in reproducing pathological chaotic dynamics such as ventricular
fibrillation during inflammatory events, for instance. The specific structure
of the governing equations suggests to cast the problem in mixed-primal form
and we write it in terms of Kirchhoff stress, displacements, solid pressure,
electric potential, activation generation, and ionic variables. We also propose
a new mixed-primal finite element method for its numerical approximation, and
we use it to explore the properties of the model and to assess the importance
of coupling terms, by means of a few computational experiments in 3D.

"  Machine learning algorithms are sensitive to so-called adversarial
perturbations. This is reminiscent of cellular decision-making where antagonist
ligands may prevent correct signaling, like during the early immune response.
We draw a formal analogy between neural networks used in machine learning and
the general class of adaptive proofreading networks. We then apply simple
adversarial strategies from machine learning to models of ligand
discrimination. We show how kinetic proofreading leads to ""boundary tilting""
and identify three types of perturbation (adversarial, non adversarial and
ambiguous). We then use a gradient-descent approach to compare different
adaptive proofreading models, and we reveal the existence of two qualitatively
different regimes characterized by the presence or absence of a critical point.
These regimes are reminiscent of the ""feature-to-prototype"" transition
identified in machine learning, corresponding to two strategies in ligand
antagonism (broad vs. specialized). Overall, our work connects evolved cellular
decision-making to classification in machine learning, showing that behaviours
close to the decision boundary can be understood through the same mechanisms.
"
"  Single individual haplotyping is an NP-hard problem that emerges when
attempting to reconstruct an organism's inherited genetic variations using data
typically generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms. Genomes of
diploid organisms, including humans, are organized into homologous pairs of
chromosomes that differ from each other in a relatively small number of variant
positions. Haplotypes are ordered sequences of the nucleotides in the variant
positions of the chromosomes in a homologous pair; for diploids, haplotypes
associated with a pair of chromosomes may be conveniently represented by means
of complementary binary sequences. In this paper, we consider a binary matrix
factorization formulation of the single individual haplotyping problem and
efficiently solve it by means of alternating minimization. We analyze the
convergence properties of the alternating minimization algorithm and establish
theoretical bounds for the achievable haplotype reconstruction error. The
proposed technique is shown to outperform existing methods when applied to
synthetic as well as real-world Fosmid-based HapMap NA12878 datasets.
"
"  The central dogma of molecular biology is the principal framework for
understanding how nucleic acid information is propagated and used by living
systems to create complex biomolecules. Here, by integrating the structural and
dynamic paradigms of DNA nanotechnology, we present a rationally designed
synthetic platform which functions in an analogous manner to create complex DNA
nanostructures. Starting from one type of DNA nanostructure, DNA strand
displacement circuits were designed to interact and pass along the information
encoded in the initial structure to mediate the self-assembly of a different
type of structure, the final output structure depending on the type of circuit
triggered. Using this concept of a DNA structure ""trans-assembling"" a different
DNA structure through non-local strand displacement circuitry, four different
schemes were implemented. Specifically, 1D ladder and 2D double-crossover (DX)
lattices were designed to kinetically trigger DNA circuits to activate
polymerization of either ring structures or another type of DX lattice under
enzyme-free, isothermal conditions. In each scheme, the desired multilayer
reaction pathway was activated, among multiple possible pathways, ultimately
leading to the downstream self-assembly of the correct output structure.
"
"  Compartmental equations are primary tools in disease spreading studies. Their
predictions are accurate for large populations but disagree with empirical and
simulated data for finite populations, where uncertainties become a relevant
factor. Starting from the agent-based approach, we investigate the role of
uncertainties and autocorrelation functions in SIS epidemic model, including
their relationship with epidemiological variables. We find new differential
equations that take uncertainties into account. The findings provide improved
predictions to the SIS model and it can offer new insights for emerging
diseases.
"
"  We study finite-size fluctuations in a network of spiking deterministic
neurons coupled with non-uniform synaptic coupling. We generalize a previously
developed theory of finite size effects for uniform globally coupled neurons.
In the uniform case, mean field theory is well defined by averaging over the
network as the number of neurons in the network goes to infinity. However, for
nonuniform coupling it is no longer possible to average over the entire network
if we are interested in fluctuations at a particular location within the
network. We show that if the coupling function approaches a continuous function
in the infinite system size limit then an average over a local neighborhood can
be defined such that mean field theory is well defined for a spatially
dependent field. We then derive a perturbation expansion in the inverse system
size around the mean field limit for the covariance of the input to a neuron
(synaptic drive) and firing rate fluctuations due to dynamical deterministic
finite-size effects.
"
"  Learning sparse linear models with two-way interactions is desirable in many
application domains such as genomics. l1-regularised linear models are popular
to estimate sparse models, yet standard implementations fail to address
specifically the quadratic explosion of candidate two-way interactions in high
dimensions, and typically do not scale to genetic data with hundreds of
thousands of features. Here we present WHInter, a working set algorithm to
solve large l1-regularised problems with two-way interactions for binary design
matrices. The novelty of WHInter stems from a new bound to efficiently identify
working sets while avoiding to scan all features, and on fast computations
inspired from solutions to the maximum inner product search problem. We apply
WHInter to simulated and real genetic data and show that it is more scalable
and two orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.
"
"  Threshold-linear networks (TLNs) are models of neural networks that consist
of simple, perceptron-like neurons and exhibit nonlinear dynamics that are
determined by the network's connectivity. The fixed points of a TLN, including
both stable and unstable equilibria, play a critical role in shaping its
emergent dynamics. In this work, we provide two novel characterizations for the
set of fixed points of a competitive TLN: the first is in terms of a simple
sign condition, while the second relies on the concept of domination. We apply
these results to a special family of TLNs, called combinatorial
threshold-linear networks (CTLNs), whose connectivity matrices are defined from
directed graphs. This leads us to prove a series of graph rules that enable one
to determine fixed points of a CTLN by analyzing the underlying graph.
Additionally, we study larger networks composed of smaller ""building block""
subnetworks, and prove several theorems relating the fixed points of the full
network to those of its components. Our results provide the foundation for a
kind of ""graphical calculus"" to infer features of the dynamics from a network's
connectivity.
"
"  Cellular Electron CryoTomography (CECT) is a 3D imaging technique that
captures information about the structure and spatial organization of
macromolecular complexes within single cells, in near-native state and at
sub-molecular resolution. Although template matching is often used to locate
macromolecules in a CECT image, it is insufficient as it only measures the
relative structural similarity. Therefore, it is preferable to assess the
statistical credibility of the decision through hypothesis testing, requiring
many templates derived from a diverse population of macromolecular structures.
Due to the very limited number of known structures, we need a generative model
to efficiently and reliably sample pseudo-structures from the complex
distribution of macromolecular structures. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel image-derived approach for performing hypothesis testing for
template matching by constructing generative models using the generative
adversarial network. Finally, we conducted hypothesis testing experiments for
template matching on both simulated and experimental subtomograms, allowing us
to conclude the identity of subtomograms with high statistical credibility and
significantly reducing false positives.
"
"  Reliable identification of molecular biomarkers is essential for accurate
patient stratification. While state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for
sample classification continue to push boundaries in terms of performance, most
of these methods are not able to integrate different data types and lack
generalization power, limiting their application in a clinical setting.
Furthermore, many methods behave as black boxes, and we have very little
understanding about the mechanisms that lead to the prediction. While
opaqueness concerning machine behaviour might not be a problem in deterministic
domains, in health care, providing explanations about the molecular factors and
phenotypes that are driving the classification is crucial to build trust in the
performance of the predictive system. We propose Pathway Induced Multiple
Kernel Learning (PIMKL), a novel methodology to reliably classify samples that
can also help gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the
classification. PIMKL exploits prior knowledge in the form of a molecular
interaction network and annotated gene sets, by optimizing a mixture of
pathway-induced kernels using a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithm, an
approach that has demonstrated excellent performance in different machine
learning applications. After optimizing the combination of kernels for
prediction of a specific phenotype, the model provides a stable molecular
signature that can be interpreted in the light of the ingested prior knowledge
and that can be used in transfer learning tasks.
"
"  We introduce Error Forward-Propagation, a biologically plausible mechanism to
propagate error feedback forward through the network. Architectural constraints
on connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain;
systematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error
feedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the
forward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be
used in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment
problem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly
successful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks.
Backpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron.
From a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural
constraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain.
This architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback
weights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity
patterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal
connections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural
constraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error
feedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error
feedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer. This mechanism,
Error Forward-Propagation, is a plausible basis for how error feedback occurs
deep in the brain independent of and yet in support of the functionality
underlying intricate network architectures. We show experimentally that
recurrent neural networks with two and three hidden layers can be trained using
Error Forward-Propagation on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving
$1.90\%$ and $11\%$ generalization errors respectively.
"
"  In the study of the human connectome, the vertices and the edges of the
network of the human brain are analyzed: the vertices of the graphs are the
anatomically identified gray matter areas of the subjects; this set is exactly
the same for all the subjects. The edges of the graphs correspond to the axonal
fibers, connecting these areas. In the biological applications of graph theory,
it happens very rarely that scientists examine numerous large graphs on the
very same, labeled vertex set. Exactly this is the case in the study of the
connectomes. Because of the particularity of these sets of graphs, novel,
robust methods need to be developed for their analysis. Here we introduce the
new method of the Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping for the connectome,
which serves as a robust identification of the neighborhoods of given vertices
of special interest in the graph. We apply the novel method for mapping the
neighborhoods of the human hippocampus and discover strong statistical
asymmetries between the connectomes of the sexes, computed from the Human
Connectome Project. We analyze 413 braingraphs, each with 463 nodes. We show
that the hippocampi of men have much more significantly frequent neighbor sets
than women; therefore, in a sense, the connections of the hippocampi are more
regularly distributed in men and more varied in women. Our results are in
contrast to the volumetric studies of the human hippocampus, where it was shown
that the relative volume of the hippocampus is the same in men and women.
"
"  The human brain network is modular--comprised of communities of tightly
interconnected nodes. This network contains local hubs, which have many
connections within their own communities, and connector hubs, which have
connections diversely distributed across communities. A mechanistic
understanding of these hubs and how they support cognition has not been
demonstrated. Here, we leveraged individual differences in hub connectivity and
cognition. We show that a model of hub connectivity accurately predicts the
cognitive performance of 476 individuals in four distinct tasks. Moreover,
there is a general optimal network structure for cognitive
performance--individuals with diversely connected hubs and consequent modular
brain networks exhibit increased cognitive performance, regardless of the task.
Critically, we find evidence consistent with a mechanistic model in which
connector hubs tune the connectivity of their neighbors to be more modular
while allowing for task appropriate information integration across communities,
which increases global modularity and cognitive performance.
"
"  Prosociality is fundamental to human social life, and, accordingly, much
research has attempted to explain human prosocial behavior. Capraro and Rand
(Judgment and Decision Making, 13, 99-111, 2018) recently provided experimental
evidence that prosociality in anonymous, one-shot interactions (such as
Prisoner's Dilemma and Dictator Game experiments) is not driven by
outcome-based social preferences - as classically assumed - but by a
generalized morality preference for ""doing the right thing"". Here we argue that
the key experiments reported in Capraro and Rand (2018) comprise prominent
methodological confounds and open questions that bear on influential
psychological theory. Specifically, their design confounds: (i) preferences for
efficiency with self-interest; and (ii) preferences for action with preferences
for morality. Furthermore, their design fails to dissociate the preference to
do ""good"" from the preference to avoid doing ""bad"". We thus designed and
conducted a preregistered, refined and extended test of the morality preference
hypothesis (N=801). Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that
prosociality in the anonymous, one-shot Dictator Game is driven by preferences
for doing the morally right thing. Inconsistent with influential psychological
theory, however, our results suggest the preference to do ""good"" was as potent
as the preference to avoid doing ""bad"" in this case.
"
"  Global integration of information in the brain results from complex
interactions of segregated brain networks. Identifying the most influential
neuronal populations that efficiently bind these networks is a fundamental
problem of systems neuroscience. Here we apply optimal percolation theory and
pharmacogenetic interventions in-vivo to predict and subsequently target nodes
that are essential for global integration of a memory network in rodents. The
theory predicts that integration in the memory network is mediated by a set of
low-degree nodes located in the nucleus accumbens. This result is confirmed
with pharmacogenetic inactivation of the nucleus accumbens, which eliminates
the formation of the memory network, while inactivations of other brain areas
leave the network intact. Thus, optimal percolation theory predicts essential
nodes in brain networks. This could be used to identify targets of
interventions to modulate brain function.
"
"  We investigated frictional effects on the folding rates of a human telomerase
hairpin (hTR HP) and H-type pseudoknot from the Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV
PK) using simulations of the Three Interaction Site (TIS) model for RNA. The
heat capacity from TIS model simulations, calculated using temperature replica
exchange simulations, reproduces nearly quantitatively the available
experimental data for the hTR HP. The corresponding results for BWYV PK serve
as predictions. We calculated the folding rates ($k_\mathrm{F}$) from more than
100 folding trajectories for each value of the solvent viscosity ($\eta$) at a
fixed salt concentration of 200 mM. By using the theoretical estimate
($\propto$$\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of nucleotides) for folding free
energy barrier, $k_\mathrm{F}$ data for both the RNAs are quantitatively fit
using one-dimensional Kramers' theory with two parameters specifying the
curvatures in the unfolded basin and the barrier top. In the high-friction
regime ($\eta\gtrsim10^{-5}\,\textrm{Pa\ensuremath{\cdot}s}$), for both HP and
PK, $k_\mathrm{F}$s decrease as $1/\eta$ whereas in the low friction regime,
$k_\mathrm{F}$ values increase as $\eta$ increases, leading to a maximum
folding rate at a moderate viscosity
($\sim10^{-6}\,\textrm{Pa\ensuremath{\cdot}s}$), which is the Kramers turnover.
From the fits, we find that the speed limit to RNA folding at water viscosity
is between 1 and 4 $\mathrm{\mu s}$, which is in accord with our previous
theoretical prediction as well as results from several single molecule
experiments. Both the RNA constructs fold by parallel pathways. Surprisingly,
we find that the flux through the pathways could be altered by changing solvent
viscosity, a prediction that is more easily testable in RNA than in proteins.
"
"  Cell monolayers provide an interesting example of active matter, exhibiting a
phase transition from a flowing to jammed state as they age. Here we report
experiments and numerical simulations illustrating how a jammed cellular layer
rapidly reverts to a flowing state after a wound. Quantitative comparison
between experiments and simulations shows that cells change their
self-propulsion and alignement strength so that the system crosses a phase
transition line, which we characterize by finite-size scaling in an active
particle model. This wound-induced unjamming transition is found to occur
generically in epithelial, endothelial and cancer cells.
"
"  The transition from single-cell to multicellular behavior is important in
early development but rarely studied. The starvation-induced aggregation of the
social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum into a multicellular slug is known to
result from single-cell chemotaxis towards emitted pulses of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP). However, how exactly do transient short-range chemical
gradients lead to coherent collective movement at a macroscopic scale? Here, we
use a multiscale model verified by quantitative microscopy to describe
wide-ranging behaviors from chemotaxis and excitability of individual cells to
aggregation of thousands of cells. To better understand the mechanism of
long-range cell-cell communication and hence aggregation, we analyze cell-cell
correlations, showing evidence for self-organization at the onset of
aggregation (as opposed to following a leader cell). Surprisingly, cell
collectives, despite their finite size, show features of criticality known from
phase transitions in physical systems. Application of external cAMP
perturbations in our simulations near the sensitive critical point allows
steering cells into early aggregation and towards certain locations but not
once an aggregation center has been chosen.
"
"  The study of genome rearrangement has many flavours, but they all are somehow
tied to edit distances on variations of a multi-graph called the breakpoint
graph. We study a weighted 2-break distance on Eulerian 2-edge-colored
multi-graphs, which generalizes weighted versions of several Double Cut and
Join problems, including those on genomes with unequal gene content. We affirm
the connection between cycle decompositions and edit scenarios first discovered
with the Sorting By Reversals problem. Using this we show that the problem of
finding a parsimonious scenario of minimum cost on an Eulerian 2-edge-colored
multi-graph - with a general cost function for 2-breaks - can be solved by
decomposing the problem into independent instances on simple alternating
cycles. For breakpoint graphs, and a more constrained cost function, based on
coloring the vertices, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a
parsimonious 2-break scenario of minimum cost, while showing that finding a
non-parsimonious 2-break scenario of minimum cost is NP-Hard.
"
"  The mainstream of research in genetics, epigenetics and imaging data analysis
focuses on statistical association or exploring statistical dependence between
variables. Despite their significant progresses in genetic research,
understanding the etiology and mechanism of complex phenotypes remains elusive.
Using association analysis as a major analytical platform for the complex data
analysis is a key issue that hampers the theoretic development of genomic
science and its application in practice. Causal inference is an essential
component for the discovery of mechanical relationships among complex
phenotypes. Many researchers suggest making the transition from association to
causation. Despite its fundamental role in science, engineering and
biomedicine, the traditional methods for causal inference require at least
three variables. However, quantitative genetic analysis such as QTL, eQTL,
mQTL, and genomic-imaging data analysis requires exploring the causal
relationships between two variables. This paper will focus on bivariate causal
discovery. We will introduce independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) as a
basic principle for causal inference, algorithmic information theory and
additive noise model (ANM) as major tools for bivariate causal discovery.
Large-scale simulations will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of the
ANM for bivariate causal discovery. To further evaluate their performance for
causal inference, the ANM will be applied to the construction of gene
regulatory networks. Also, the ANM will be applied to trait-imaging data
analysis to illustrate three scenarios: presence of both causation and
association, presence of association while absence of causation, and presence
of causation, while lack of association between two variables.
"
"  Protein gamma-turn prediction is useful in protein function studies and
experimental design. Several methods for gamma-turn prediction have been
developed, but the results were unsatisfactory with Matthew correlation
coefficients (MCC) around 0.2-0.4. One reason for the low prediction accuracy
is the limited capacity of the methods; in particular, the traditional
machine-learning methods like SVM may not extract high-level features well to
distinguish between turn or non-turn. Hence, it is worthwhile exploring new
machine-learning methods for the prediction. A cutting-edge deep neural
network, named Capsule Network (CapsuleNet), provides a new opportunity for
gamma-turn prediction. Even when the number of input samples is relatively
small, the capsules from CapsuleNet are very effective to extract high-level
features for classification tasks. Here, we propose a deep inception capsule
network for gamma-turn prediction. Its performance on the gamma-turn benchmark
GT320 achieved an MCC of 0.45, which significantly outperformed the previous
best method with an MCC of 0.38. This is the first gamma-turn prediction method
utilizing deep neural networks. Also, to our knowledge, it is the first
published bioinformatics application utilizing capsule network, which will
provides a useful example for the community.

"  Micro-sized cold atmospheric plasma (uCAP) has been developed to expand the
applications of CAP in cancer therapy. In this paper, uCAP devices with
different nozzle lengths were applied to investigate effects on both brain
(glioblastoma U87) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells. Various diagnostic
techniques were employed to evaluate the parameters of uCAP devices with
different lengths such as potential distribution, electron density, and optical
emission spectroscopy. The generation of short- and long-lived species (such as
hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrite
(NO2-), et al) were studied. These data revealed that uCAP treatment with a 20
mm length tube has a stronger effect than that of the 60 mm tube due to the
synergetic effects of reactive species and free radicals. Reactive species
generated by uCAP enhanced tumor cell death in a dose-dependent fashion and was
not specific with regards to tumor cell type.

"  One of the most exciting advancements in AI over the last decade is the wide
adoption of ANNs, such as DNN and CNN, in many real-world applications.
However, the underlying massive amounts of computation and storage requirement
greatly challenge their applicability in resource-limited platforms like the
drone, mobile phone, and IoT devices etc. The third generation of neural
network model--Spiking Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the working mechanism
and efficiency of human brain, has emerged as a promising solution for
achieving more impressive computing and power efficiency within light-weighted
devices (e.g. single chip). However, the relevant research activities have been
narrowly carried out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for
fulfilling the practical cognitive tasks, underestimating SNN's energy
efficiency, throughput, and system flexibility. Although the time-based SNN can
be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic
applications due to lack of efficient coding and practical learning schemes. In
this work, a Precise-Time-Dependent Single Spike Neuromorphic Architecture,
namely ""PT-Spike"", is developed to bridge this gap. Three constituent
hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding,
efficient supervised temporal learning, and fast asymmetric decoding are
proposed accordingly to boost the energy efficiency and data processing
capability of the time-based SNN at a more compact neural network model size
when executing real cognitive tasks. Simulation results show that ""PT-Spike""
demonstrates significant improvements in network size, processing efficiency
and power consumption with marginal classification accuracy degradation when
compared with the rate-based SNN and ANN under the similar network
configuration.

"  Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) affect patients in hospitals and in
the community, but the relative importance of transmission in each setting is
unknown. We developed a mathematical model of C. difficile transmission in a
hospital and surrounding community that included infants, adults, and
transmission from animal reservoirs. We assessed the role of these transmission
routes in maintaining disease and evaluated the recommended classification
system for hospital and community-acquired CDIs. The reproduction number in the
hospital was <1 (range: 0.16-0.46) for all scenarios. Outside the hospital, the
reproduction number was >1 for nearly all scenarios without transmission from
animal reservoirs (range: 1.0-1.34). However, the reproduction number for the
human population was <1 if a minority (>3.5-26.0%) of human exposures
originated from animal reservoirs. Symptomatic adults accounted for <10%
transmission in the community. Under conservative assumptions, infants
accounted for 17% of community transmission. An estimated 33-40% of
community-acquired cases were reported but 28-39% of these reported cases were
misclassified as hospital-acquired by recommended definitions. Transmission
could be plausibly sustained by asymptomatically colonized adults and infants
in the community or exposure to animal reservoirs, but not hospital
transmission alone. Underreporting of community-onset cases and systematic
misclassification underplays the role of community transmission.

"  Biological systems are typically highly open, non-equilibrium systems that
are very challenging to understand from a statistical mechanics perspective.
While statistical treatments of evolutionary biological systems have a long and
rich history, examination of the time-dependent non-equilibrium dynamics has
been less studied. In this paper we first derive a generalized master equation
in the genotype space for diploid organisms incorporating the processes of
selection, mutation, recombination, and reproduction. The master equation is
defined in terms of continuous time and can handle an arbitrary number of gene
loci and alleles, and can be defined in terms of an absolute population or
probabilities. We examine and analytically solve several prototypical cases
which illustrate the interplay of the various processes and discuss the
timescales of their evolution. The entropy production during the evolution
towards steady state is calculated and we find that it agrees with predictions
from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics where it is large when the
population distribution evolves towards a more viable genotype. The stability
of the non-equilibrium steady state is confirmed using the Glansdorff-Prigogine
criterion.

"  We are concerned about burst synchronization (BS), related to neural
information processes in health and disease, in the Barabási-Albert
scale-free network (SFN) composed of inhibitory bursting Hindmarsh-Rose
neurons. This inhibitory neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic
strengths governed by the inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP).
In previous works without considering iSTDP, BS was found to appear in a range
of noise intensities for fixed synaptic inhibition strengths. In contrast, in
our present work, we take into consideration iSTDP and investigate its effect
on BS by varying the noise intensity. Our new main result is to find occurrence
of a Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity: good BS gets better via
LTD, while bad BS get worse via LTP. This kind of Matthew effect in inhibitory
synaptic plasticity is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity
where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). We note
that, due to inhibition, the roles of LTD and LTP in inhibitory synaptic
plasticity are reversed in comparison with those in excitatory synaptic
plasticity. Moreover, emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition
strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the
distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic burst onset
times. Finally, in the presence of iSTDP we investigate the effects of network
architecture on BS by varying the symmetric attachment degree $l^*$ and the
asymmetry parameter $\Delta l$ in the SFN.

"  IntroductionThe free and cued selective reminding test is used to identify
memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment and demented patients. It allows
assessing three processes: encoding, storage, and recollection of verbal
episodic memory.MethodsWe investigated the neural correlates of these three
memory processes in a large cohort study. The Memento cohort enrolled 2323
outpatients presenting either with subjective cognitive decline or mild
cognitive impairment who underwent cognitive, structural MRI and, for a subset,
fluorodeoxyglucose--positron emission tomography evaluations.ResultsEncoding
was associated with a network including parietal and temporal cortices; storage
was mainly associated with entorhinal and parahippocampal regions, bilaterally;
retrieval was associated with a widespread network encompassing frontal
regions.DiscussionThe neural correlates of episodic memory processes can be
assessed in large and standardized cohorts of patients at risk for Alzheimer's
disease. Their relation to pathophysiological markers of Alzheimer's disease
remains to be studied.

"  We explore the emergence of persistent infection in a closed region where the
disease progression of the individuals is given by the SIRS model, with an
individual becoming infected on contact with another infected individual within
a given range. We focus on the role of synchronization in the persistence of
contagion. Our key result is that higher degree of synchronization, both
globally in the population and locally in the neighborhoods, hinders
persistence of infection. Importantly, we find that early short-time asynchrony
appears to be a consistent precursor to future persistence of infection, and
can potentially provide valuable early warnings for sustained contagion in a
population patch. Thus transient synchronization can help anticipate the
long-term persistence of infection. Further we demonstrate that when the range
of influence of an infected individual is wider, one obtains lower persistent
infection. This counter-intuitive observation can also be understood through
the relation of synchronization to infection burn-out.
"
"  We introduce the exit time finite state projection (ETFSP) scheme, a
truncation-based method that yields approximations to the exit distribution and
occupation measure associated with the time of exit from a domain (i.e., the
time of first passage to the complement of the domain) of time-homogeneous
continuous-time Markov chains. We prove that: (i) the computed approximations
bound the measures from below; (ii) the total variation distances between the
approximations and the measures decrease monotonically as states are added to
the truncation; and (iii) the scheme converges, in the sense that, as the
truncation tends to the entire state space, the total variation distances tend
to zero. Furthermore, we give a computable bound on the total variation
distance between the exit distribution and its approximation, and we delineate
the cases in which the bound is sharp. We also revisit the related finite state
projection scheme and give a comprehensive account of its theoretical
properties. We demonstrate the use of the ETFSP scheme by applying it to two
biological examples: the computation of the first passage time associated with
the expression of a gene, and the fixation times of competing species subject
to demographic noise.

"  What role do asymptomatically infected individuals play in the transmission
dynamics? There are many diseases, such as norovirus and influenza, where some
infected hosts show symptoms of the disease while others are asymptomatically
infected, i.e. do not show any symptoms. The current paper considers a class of
epidemic models following an SEIR (Susceptible $\to$ Exposed $\to$ Infectious
$\to$ Recovered) structure that allows for both symptomatic and asymptomatic
cases. The following question is addressed: what fraction $\rho$ of those
individuals getting infected are infected by symptomatic (asymptomatic) cases?
This is a more complicated question than the related question for the beginning
of the epidemic: what fraction of the expected number of secondary cases of a
typical newly infected individual, i.e. what fraction of the basic reproduction
number $R_0$, is caused by symptomatic individuals? The latter fraction only
depends on the type-specific reproduction numbers, while the former fraction
$\rho$ also depends on timing and hence on the probabilistic distributions of
latent and infectious periods of the two types (not only their means). Bounds
on $\rho$ are derived for the situation where these distributions (and even
their means) are unknown. Special attention is given to the class of Markov
models and the class of continuous-time Reed-Frost models as two classes of
distribution functions. We show how these two classes of models can exhibit
very different behaviour.

"  Currently, third-generation sequencing techniques, which allow to obtain much
longer DNA reads compared to the next-generation sequencing technologies, are
becoming more and more popular. There are many possibilities to combine data
from next-generation and third-generation sequencing.
Herein, we present a new application called dnaasm-link for linking contigs,
a result of \textit{de novo} assembly of second-generation sequencing data,
with long DNA reads. Our tool includes an integrated module to fill gaps with a
suitable fragment of appropriate long DNA read, which improves the consistency
of the resulting DNA sequences. This feature is very important, in particular
for complex DNA regions, as presented in the paper. Finally, our implementation
outperforms other state-of-the-art tools in terms of speed and memory
requirements, which may enable the usage of the presented application for
organisms with a large genome, which is not possible in~existing applications.
The presented application has many advantages as (i) significant memory
optimization and reduction of computation time (ii) filling the gaps through
the appropriate fragment of a specified long DNA read (iii) reducing number of
spanned and unspanned gaps in the existing genome drafts.

"  The registration of tremor was performed in two groups of subjects (15 people
in each group) with different physical fitness at rest and at a static loads of
3N. Each subject has been tested 15 series (number of series N=15) in both
states (with and without physical loads) and each series contained 15 samples
(n=15) of tremorogramm measurements (500 elements in each sample, registered
coordinates x1(t) of the finger position relative to eddy current sensor) of
the finger. Using non-parametric Wilcoxon test of each series of experiment a
pairwise comparison was made forming 15 tables in which the results of
calculation of pairwise comparison was presented as a matrix (15x15) for

without load and under the impact of physical load (3N), which showed an
increase almost in twice in the number k of pairs of matching samples of
tremorogramms at conditions of a static load. For all these samples it was

"  Probabilistic atlases provide essential spatial contextual information for
image interpretation, Bayesian modeling, and algorithmic processing. Such
atlases are typically constructed by grouping subjects with similar demographic
information. Importantly, use of the same scanner minimizes inter-group
variability. However, generalizability and spatial specificity of such
approaches is more limited than one might like. Inspired by Commowick
""Frankenstein's creature paradigm"" which builds a personal specific anatomical
atlas, we propose a data-driven framework to build a personal specific
probabilistic atlas under the large-scale data scheme. The data-driven
framework clusters regions with similar features using a point distribution
model to learn different anatomical phenotypes. Regional structural atlases and
corresponding regional probabilistic atlases are used as indices and targets in
the dictionary. By indexing the dictionary, the whole brain probabilistic
atlases adapt to each new subject quickly and can be used as spatial priors for
visualization and processing. The novelties of this approach are (1) it
provides a new perspective of generating personal specific whole brain
probabilistic atlases (132 regions) under data-driven scheme across sites. (2)
The framework employs the large amount of heterogeneous data (2349 images). (3)
The proposed framework achieves low computational cost since only one affine
registration and Pearson correlation operation are required for a new subject.
Our method matches individual regions better with higher Dice similarity value
when testing the probabilistic atlases. Importantly, the advantage the
large-scale scheme is demonstrated by the better performance of using
large-scale training data (1888 images) than smaller training set (720 images).

"  Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) is a tomographic technique that can be
used to measure the three-dimensional (3D) refractive index distribution within
living cells without the requirement of any marker. In principle, ODT can be
regarded as a generalization of optical projection tomography which is
equivalent to computerized tomography (CT). Both optical tomographic techniques
require projection-phase images of cells measured at multiple angles. However,
the reconstruction of the 3D refractive index distribution post-measurement
differs for the two techniques. It is known that ODT yields better results than
projection tomography, because it takes into account diffraction of the imaging
light due to the refractive index structure of the sample. Here, we apply ODT
to biological cells in a microfluidic chip which combines optical trapping and
microfluidic flow to achieve an optofluidic single-cell rotation. In
particular, we address the problem that arises when the trapped cell is not
rotating about an axis perpendicular to the imaging plane, but instead about an
arbitrarily tilted axis. In this paper we show that the 3D reconstruction can
be improved by taking into account such a tilted rotational axis in the
reconstruction process.
"
"  Randomizing the Fourier-transform (FT) phases of temporal-spatial data
generates surrogates that approximate examples from the data-generating
distribution. We propose such FT surrogates as a novel tool to augment and
analyze training of neural networks and explore the approach in the example of
sleep-stage classification. By computing FT surrogates of raw EEG, EOG, and EMG
signals of under-represented sleep stages, we balanced the CAPSLPDB sleep
database. We then trained and tested a convolutional neural network for sleep
stage classification, and found that our surrogate-based augmentation improved
the mean F1-score by 7%. As another application of FT surrogates, we formulated
an approach to compute saliency maps for individual sleep epochs. The
visualization is based on the response of inferred class probabilities under
replacement of short data segments by partial surrogates. To quantify how well
the distributions of the surrogates and the original data match, we evaluated a
trained classifier on surrogates of correctly classified examples, and
summarized these conditional predictions in a confusion matrix. We show how
such conditional confusion matrices can qualitatively explain the performance
of surrogates in class balancing. The FT-surrogate augmentation approach may
improve classification on noisy signals if carefully adapted to the data
distribution under analysis.

"  The design of multi-stable RNA molecules has important applications in
biology, medicine, and biotechnology. Synthetic design approaches profit
strongly from effective in-silico methods, which can tremendously impact their
cost and feasibility. We revisit a central ingredient of most in-silico design
methods: the sampling of sequences for the design of multi-target structures,
possibly including pseudoknots. For this task, we present the efficient, tree
decomposition-based algorithm. Our fixed parameter tractable approach is
underpinned by establishing the P-hardness of uniform sampling. Modeling the
problem as a constraint network, our program supports generic
Boltzmann-weighted sampling for arbitrary additive RNA energy models; this
enables the generation of RNA sequences meeting specific goals like expected
free energies or \GCb-content. Finally, we empirically study general properties
of the approach and generate biologically relevant multi-target
Boltzmann-weighted designs for a common design benchmark. Generating seed
sequences with our program, we demonstrate significant improvements over the
previously best multi-target sampling strategy (uniform sampling).Our software

"  Amino acid sequence portrays most intrinsic form of a protein and expresses
primary structure of protein. The order of amino acids in a sequence enables a
protein to acquire a particular stable conformation that is responsible for the
functions of the protein. This relationship between a sequence and its function
motivates the need to analyse the sequences for predicting protein functions.
Early generation computational methods using BLAST, FASTA, etc. perform
function transfer based on sequence similarity with existing databases and are
computationally slow. Although machine learning based approaches are fast, they
fail to perform well for long protein sequences (i.e., protein sequences with
more than 300 amino acid residues). In this paper, we introduce a novel method
for construction of two separate feature sets for protein sequences based on
analysis of 1) single fixed-sized segments and 2) multi-sized segments, using
bi-directional long short-term memory network. Further, model based on proposed
feature set is combined with the state of the art Multi-lable Linear
Discriminant Analysis (MLDA) features based model to improve the accuracy.
Extensive evaluations using separate datasets for biological processes and
molecular functions demonstrate promising results for both single-sized and
multi-sized segments based feature sets. While former showed an improvement of
+3.37% and +5.48%, the latter produces an improvement of +5.38% and +8.00%
respectively for two datasets over the state of the art MLDA based classifier.
After combining two models, there is a significant improvement of +7.41% and
+9.21% respectively for two datasets compared to MLDA based classifier.
Specifically, the proposed approach performed well for the long protein
sequences and superior overall performance.

"  The potential benefits of applying machine learning methods to -omics data
are becoming increasingly apparent, especially in clinical settings. However,
the unique characteristics of these data are not always well suited to machine
learning techniques. These data are often generated across different
technologies in different labs, and frequently with high dimensionality. In
this paper we present a framework for combining -omics data sets, and for
handling high dimensional data, making -omics research more accessible to
machine learning applications. We demonstrate the success of this framework
through integration and analysis of multi-analyte data for a set of 3,533
breast cancers. We then use this data-set to predict breast cancer patient
survival for individuals at risk of an impending event, with higher accuracy
and lower variance than methods trained on individual data-sets. We hope that
our pipelines for data-set generation and transformation will open up -omics
data to machine learning researchers. We have made these freely available for

"  Intrinsic stochasticity can induce highly non-trivial effects on dynamical
systems, including stochastic and coherence resonance, noise induced
bistability, noise-induced oscillations, to name but a few. In this paper we
revisit a mechanism first investigated in the context of neuroscience by which
relatively small demographic (intrinsic) fluctuations can lead to the emergence
of avalanching behavior in systems that are deterministically characterized by
a single stable fixed point (up state). The anomalously large response of such
systems to stochasticity stems (or is strongly associated with) the existence
of a ""non-normal"" stability matrix at the deterministic fixed point, which may
induce the system to be ""reactive"". Here, we further investigate this mechanism
by exploring the interplay between non-normality and intrinsic (demographic)
stochasticity, by employing a number of analytical and computational
approaches. We establish, in particular, that the resulting dynamics in this
type of systems cannot be simply derived from a scalar potential but,
additionally, one needs to consider a curl flux which describes the essential
non-equilibrium nature of this type of noisy non-normal systems. Moreover, we
shed further light on the origin of the phenomenon, introduce the novel concept
of ""non-linear reactivity"", and rationalize of the observed the value of the
emerging avalanche exponents.

"  A pervasive belief with regard to the differences between human language and
animal vocal sequences (song) is that they belong to different classes of
computational complexity, with animal song belonging to regular languages,
whereas human language is superregular. This argument, however, lacks empirical
evidence since superregular analyses of animal song are understudied. The goal
of this paper is to perform a superregular analysis of animal song, using data
from gibbons as a case study, and demonstrate that a superregular analysis can
be effectively used with non-human data. A key finding is that a superregular
analysis does not increase explanatory power but rather provides for compact
analysis. For instance, fewer grammatical rules are necessary once
superregularity is allowed. This pattern is analogous to a previous
computational analysis of human language, and accordingly, the null hypothesis,
that human language and animal song are governed by the same type of
grammatical systems, cannot be rejected.

"  HIV RNA viral load (VL) is an important outcome variable in studies of HIV
infected persons. There exists only a handful of methods which classify
patients by viral load patterns. Most methods place limits on the use of viral
load measurements, are often specific to a particular study design, and do not
account for complex, temporal variation. To address this issue, we propose a
set of four unambiguous computable characteristics (features) of time-varying
HIV viral load patterns, along with a novel centroid-based classification
algorithm, which we use to classify a population of 1,576 HIV positive clinic
patients into one of five different viral load patterns (clusters) often found
in the literature: durably suppressed viral load (DSVL), sustained low viral
load (SLVL), sustained high viral load (SHVL), high viral load suppression
(HVLS), and rebounding viral load (RVL). The centroid algorithm summarizes
these clusters in terms of their centroids and radii. We show that this allows
new viral load patterns to be assigned pattern membership based on the distance
from the centroid relative to its radius, which we term radial normalization
classification. This method has the benefit of providing an objective and
quantitative method to assign viral load pattern membership with a concise and
interpretable model that aids clinical decision making. This method also
facilitates meta-analyses by providing computably distinct HIV categories.
Finally we propose that this novel centroid algorithm could also be useful in
the areas of cluster comparison for outcomes research and data reduction in
machine learning.

"  Second generation sequencing technologies are being increasingly used for
genetic association studies, where the main research interest is to identify
sets of genetic variants that contribute to various phenotype. The phenotype
can be univariate disease status, multivariate responses and even
high-dimensional outcomes. Considering the genotype and phenotype as two
complex objects, this also poses a general statistical problem of testing
association between complex objects. We here proposed a similarity-based test,
generalized similarity U (GSU), that can test the association between complex
objects. We first studied the theoretical properties of the test in a general
setting and then focused on the application of the test to sequencing
association studies. Based on theoretical analysis, we proposed to use
Laplacian kernel based similarity for GSU to boost power and enhance
robustness. Through simulation, we found that GSU did have advantages over
existing methods in terms of power and robustness. We further performed a whole
genome sequencing (WGS) scan for Alzherimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) data, identifying three genes, APOE, APOC1 and TOMM40, associated with
imaging phenotype. We developed a C++ package for analysis of whole genome
sequencing data using GSU. The source codes can be downloaded at

"  Biological and artificial neural systems are composed of many local
processors, and their capabilities depend upon the transfer function that
relates each local processor's outputs to its inputs. This paper uses a recent
advance in the foundations of information theory to study the properties of
local processors that use contextual input to amplify or attenuate transmission
of information about their driving inputs. This advance enables the information
transmitted by processors with two distinct inputs to be decomposed into those
components unique to each input, that shared between the two inputs, and that
which depends on both though it is in neither, i.e. synergy. The decompositions
that we report here show that contextual modulation has information processing
properties that contrast with those of all four simple arithmetic operators,
that it can take various forms, and that the form used in our previous studies
of artificial neural nets composed of local processors with both driving and
contextual inputs is particularly well-suited to provide the distinctive
capabilities of contextual modulation under a wide range of conditions. We
argue that the decompositions reported here could be compared with those
obtained from empirical neurobiological and psychophysical data under
conditions thought to reflect contextual modulation. That would then shed new
light on the underlying processes involved. Finally, we suggest that such
decompositions could aid the design of context-sensitive machine learning
algorithms.

"  We study the most probable trajectories of the concentration evolution for
the transcription factor activator in a genetic regulation system, with
non-Gaussian stable Lévy noise in the synthesis reaction rate taking into
account. We calculate the most probable trajectory by spatially maximizing the
probability density of the system path, i.e., the solution of the associated
nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation. We especially examine those most probable
trajectories from low concentration state to high concentration state (i.e.,
the likely transcription regime) for certain parameters, in order to gain
insights into the transcription processes and the tipping time for the
transcription likely to occur. This enables us: (i) to visualize the progress
of concentration evolution (i.e., observe whether the system enters the
transcription regime within a given time period); (ii) to predict or avoid
certain transcriptions via selecting specific noise parameters in particular
regions in the parameter space. Moreover, we have found some peculiar or
counter-intuitive phenomena in this gene model system, including (a) a smaller
noise intensity may trigger the transcription process, while a larger noise
intensity can not, under the same asymmetric Lévy noise. This phenomenon does
not occur in the case of symmetric Lévy noise; (b) the symmetric Lévy
motion always induces transition to high concentration, but certain asymmetric
Lévy motions do not trigger the switch to transcription. These findings
provide insights for further experimental research, in order to achieve or to
avoid specific gene transcriptions, with possible relevance for medical
advances.

"  Automatic sleep staging is a challenging problem and state-of-the-art
algorithms have not yet reached satisfactory performance to be used instead of
manual scoring by a sleep technician. Much research has been done to find good
feature representations that extract the useful information to correctly
classify each epoch into the correct sleep stage. While many useful features
have been discovered, the amount of features have grown to an extent that a
feature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of
dimensionality. One reason for the need of such a large feature set is that
many features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are
less informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature
representation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an
auto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the
training batch. This selective attention allows the model to learn feature
representations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to
perform any dimensionality reduction of the input data. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large data set of polysomnography (PSG)
night recordings of patients with sleep-disordered breathing. The performance
of the auto-encoder with selective attention is compared with a regular
auto-encoder and previous works using a deep belief network (DBN).

"  Biological systems, from a cell to the human brain, are inherently complex. A
powerful representation of such systems, described by an intricate web of
relationships across multiple scales, is provided by complex networks.
Recently, several studies are highlighting how simple networks -- obtained by
aggregating or neglecting temporal or categorical description of biological
data -- are not able to account for the richness of information characterizing
biological systems. More complex models, namely multilayer networks, are needed
to account for interdependencies, often varying across time, of biological
interacting units within a cell, a tissue or parts of an organism.

"  Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample
from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised)
approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully
exploits GPU parallelism. However, such simple approximate posteriors are often
insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.
While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for
continuous latents, some problems have discrete latents and strong statistical
dependencies. The most natural approach to model these dependencies is an
autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently
sequential and thus slow. We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for
autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables
efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space latent
variable dynamical systems. To optimize the variational bound, we considered
two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into
the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic
latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a
normalizing flow. We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave
considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate
posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former
approach. Using our fast sampling procedure, we were able to realize the
benefits of correlated posteriors, including accurate uncertainty estimates for
one cell, and accurate connectivity estimates for multiple cells, in an order
of magnitude less time.

"  We propose three properties that are related to the stationary population
identity (SPI) of population biology by connecting it with stationary
populations and non-stationary populations which are approaching stationarity.
These properties provide deeper insights into cohort formation in real-world
populations and the length of the duration for which stationary and
non-stationary conditions hold. The new concepts are based on the time gap
between the occurrence of stationary and non-stationary populations within the
SPI framework that we refer to as Oscillatory SPI and the Amplitude of SPI.

"  Exploiting others is beneficial individually but it could also be detrimental
globally. The reverse is also true: a higher cooperation level may change the
environment in a way that is beneficial for all competitors. To explore the
possible consequence of this feedback we consider a coevolutionary model where
the local cooperation level determines the payoff values of the applied
prisoner's dilemma game. We observe that the coevolutionary rule provides a
significantly higher cooperation level comparing to the traditional setup
independently of the topology of the applied interaction graph. Interestingly,
this cooperation supporting mechanism offers lonely defectors a high surviving
chance for a long period hence the relaxation to the final cooperating state
happens logarithmically slow. As a consequence, the extension of the
traditional evolutionary game by considering interactions with the environment
provides a good opportunity for cooperators, but their reward may arrive with
some delay.

"  Dispersal is ubiquitous throughout the tree of life: factors selecting for
dispersal include kin competition, inbreeding avoidance and spatiotemporal
variation in resources or habitat suitability. These factors differ in whether
they promote male and female dispersal equally strongly, and often selection on
dispersal of one sex depends on how much the other disperses. For example, for
inbreeding avoidance it can be sufficient that one sex disperses away from the
natal site. Attempts to understand sex-specific dispersal evolution have
created a rich body of theoretical literature, which we review here. We
highlight an interesting gap between empirical and theoretical literature. The
former associates different patterns of sex-biased dispersal with mating
systems, such as female-biased dispersal in monogamous birds and male-biased
dispersal in polygynous mammals. The predominant explanation is traceable back
to Greenwood's (1980) ideas of how successful philopatric or dispersing
individuals are at gaining mates or resources required to attract them. Theory,
however, has developed surprisingly independently of these ideas: predominant
ideas in theoretical work track how immigration and emigration change
relatedness patterns and alleviate competition for limiting resources,
typically considered sexually distinct, with breeding sites and fertilisable
females limiting reproductive success for females and males, respectively. We
show that the link between mating system and sex-biased dispersal is far from
resolved: there are studies showing that mating systems matter, but the
oft-stated association between polygyny and male-biased dispersal is not a
straightforward theoretical expectation... (full abstract in the PDF)

"  Recurrent neural networks have been extensively studied in the context of
neuroscience and machine learning due to their ability to implement complex
computations. While substantial progress in designing effective learning
algorithms has been achieved in the last years, a full understanding of trained
recurrent networks is still lacking. Specifically, the mechanisms that allow
computations to emerge from the underlying recurrent dynamics are largely
unknown. Here we focus on a simple, yet underexplored computational setup: a
feedback architecture trained to associate a stationary output to a stationary
input. As a starting point, we derive an approximate analytical description of
global dynamics in trained networks which assumes uncorrelated connectivity
weights in the feedback and in the random bulk. The resulting mean-field theory
suggests that the task admits several classes of solutions, which imply
different stability properties. Different classes are characterized in terms of
the geometrical arrangement of the readout with respect to the input vectors,
defined in the high-dimensional space spanned by the network population. We
find that such approximate theoretical approach can be used to understand how
standard training techniques implement the input-output task in finite-size
feedback networks. In particular, our simplified description captures the local
and the global stability properties of the target solution, and thus predicts
training performance.

"  Bakground: With the proliferation of available microarray and high throughput
sequencing experiments in the public domain, the use of meta-analysis methods
increases. In these experiments, where the sample size is often limited,
meta-analysis offers the possibility to considerably enhance the statistical
power and give more accurate results. For those purposes, it combines either
effect sizes or results of single studies in a appropriate manner. R packages
metaMA and metaRNASeq perform meta-analysis on microarray and NGS data,
respectively. They are not interchangeable as they rely on statistical modeling
specific to each technology.
Results: SMAGEXP (Statistical Meta-Analysis for Gene EXPression) integrates
metaMA and metaRNAseq packages into Galaxy. We aim to propose a unified way to
carry out meta-analysis of gene expression data, while taking care of their
specificities. We have developed this tool suite to analyse microarray data
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database or custom data from affymetrix
microarrays. These data are then combined to carry out meta-analysis using
metaMA package. SMAGEXP also offers to combine raw read counts from Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments using DESeq2 and metaRNASeq package. In
both cases, key values, independent from the technology type, are reported to
judge the quality of the meta-analysis. These tools are available on the Galaxy
main tool shed. Source code, help and installation instructions are available
on github.
Conclusion: The use of Galaxy offers an easy-to-use gene expression
meta-analysis tool suite based on the metaMA and metaRNASeq packages.

"  The minimal number of rooted subtree prune and regraft (rSPR) operations
needed to transform one phylogenetic tree into another one induces a metric on
phylogenetic trees - the rSPR-distance. The rSPR-distance between two
phylogenetic trees $T$ and $T'$ can be characterised by a maximum agreement
forest; a forest with a minimal number of components that covers both $T$ and
$T'$. The rSPR operation has recently been generalised to phylogenetic networks
with, among others, the subnetwork prune and regraft (SNPR) operation. Here, we
introduce maximum agreement graphs as an explicit representations of
differences of two phylogenetic networks, thus generalising maximum agreement
forests. We show that maximum agreement graphs induce a metric on phylogenetic
networks - the agreement distance. While this metric does not characterise the
distances induced by SNPR and other generalisations of rSPR, we prove that it
still bounds these distances with constant factors.

"  Aim: The Akaike information Criterion (AIC) is widely used science to make
predictions about complex phenomena based on an entire set of models weighted
by Akaike weights. This approach (AIC model averaging; hereafter AvgAICc) is
often preferable than alternatives based on the selection of a single model.
Surprisingly, AvgAICc has not yet been introduced in ecological niche modeling
(ENM). We aimed to introduce AvgAICc in the context of ENM to serve both as an
optimality criterion in analyses that tune-up model parameters and as a
multi-model prediction strategy.
Innovation: Results from the AvgAICc approach differed from those of
alternative approaches with respect to model complexity, contribution of
environmental variables, and predicted amount and geographic location of
suitable conditions for the focal species. Two theoretical properties of the
AvgAICc approach might justify that future studies will prefer its use over
alternative approaches: (1) it is not limited to make predictions based on a
single model, but it also uses secondary models that might have important
predictive power absent in a given single model favored by alternative
optimality criteria; (2) it balances goodness of fit and model accuracy, this
being of critical importance in applications of ENM that require model
transference.
Main conclusions: Our introduction of the AvgAICc approach in ENM; its
theoretical properties, which are expected to confer advantages over
alternatives approaches; and the differences we found when comparing the
AvgAICc approach with alternative ones; should eventually lead to a wider use
of the AvgAICc approach. Our work should also promote further methodological
research comparing properties of the AvgAICc approach with respect to those of
alternative procedures.

"  The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat
patients with complex diseases and co-existing conditions. However, a major
consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for
the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug
interactions, in which activity of one drug may change if taken with another
drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is limited because these complex
relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small
clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an
important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality. Here,
we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The
approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions,
drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are
represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a
different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal
graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph
convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal
networks. Decagon predicts the exact side effect, if any, through which a given
drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy
side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it
automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of
co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models
particularly well side effects with a strong molecular basis, while on
predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because
of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon creates
opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient data to flag and
prioritize side effects for follow-up analysis.

"  INTRODUCTION: Advanced machine learning methods might help to identify
dementia risk from neuroimaging, but their accuracy to date is unclear.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for
machine learning studies differentiating healthy ageing through to dementia of
various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different
disease boundaries.
RESULTS: Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs
healthy controls, used ADNI data, support vector machines and only T1-weighted
sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating AD from healthy controls,
and poor for differentiating healthy controls vs MCI vs AD, or MCI converters
vs non-converters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by
data source, sample size or machine learning method.
DISCUSSION: Machine learning does not differentiate clinically-relevant
disease categories yet. More diverse datasets, combinations of different types
of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to
advance the field.

"  Graphene has the potential to make a very significant impact on society, with
important applications in the biomedical field. The possibility to engineer
graphene-based medical devices at the neuronal interface is of particular
interest, making it imperative to determine the biocompatibility of graphene
materials with neuronal cells. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of
the effects of chronic and acute exposure of rat primary cortical neurons to
few-layers pristine graphene (GR) and monolayer graphene oxide (GO) flakes. By
combining a range of cell biology, microscopy, electrophysiology and omics
approaches we characterized the graphene neuron interaction from the first
steps of membrane contact and internalization to the long-term effects on cell
viability, synaptic transmission and cell metabolism. GR/GO flakes are found in
contact with the neuronal membrane, free in the cytoplasm and internalized
through the endolysosomal pathway, with no significant impact on neuron
viability. However, GO exposure selectively caused the inhibition of excitatory
transmission, paralleled by a reduction in the number of excitatory synaptic
contacts, and a concomitant enhancement of the inhibitory activity. This was
accompanied by induction of autophagy, altered Ca2+ dynamics and by a
downregulation of some of the main players in the regulation of Ca2+
homeostasis in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Our results show that,
although graphene exposure does not impact on neuron viability, it does
nevertheless have important effects on neuronal transmission and network
functionality, thus warranting caution when planning to employ this material
for neuro-biological applications.

"  The prefrontal cortex is known to be involved in many high-level cognitive
functions, in particular, working memory. Here, we study to what extent a group
of randomly connected units (namely an Echo State Network, ESN) can store and
maintain (as output) an arbitrary real value from a streamed input, i.e. can
act as a sustained working memory unit. Furthermore, we explore to what extent
such an architecture can take advantage of the stored value in order to produce
non-linear computations. Comparison between different architectures (with and
without feedback, with and without a working memory unit) shows that an
explicit memory improves the performances.

"  Neuronal network dynamics depends on network structure. It is often assumed
that neurons are connected at random when their actual connectivity structure
is unknown. Such models are then often approximated by replacing the random
network by an all-to-all network, where every neuron is connected to all other
neurons. This mean-field approximation is a common approach in statistical
physics. In this paper we show that such approximation can be invalid. We solve
analytically a neuronal network model with binary-state neurons in both random
and all-to-all networks. We find strikingly different phase diagrams
corresponding to each network structure. Neuronal network dynamics is not only
different within certain parameter ranges, but it also undergoes different
bifurcations. Our results therefore suggest cautiousness when using mean-field
models based on all-to-all network topologies to represent random networks.

"  Linked beneficial and deleterious mutations are known to decrease the
fixation probability of a favorable mutation in large asexual populations.
While the hindering effect of strongly deleterious mutations on adaptive
evolution has been well studied, how weak deleterious mutations, either in
isolation or with superior beneficial mutations, influence the fixation of a
beneficial mutation has not been fully explored. Here, using a multitype
branching process, we obtain an accurate analytical expression for the fixation
probability when deleterious effects are weak, and exploit this result along
with the clonal interference theory to investigate the joint effect of linked
beneficial and deleterious mutations on the rate of adaptation. We find that
when the mutation rate is increased beyond the beneficial fitness effect, the
fixation probability of the beneficial mutant decreases from Haldane's
classical result towards zero. This has the consequence that above a critical
mutation rate that may depend on the population size, the adaptation rate
decreases exponentially with the mutation rate and is independent of the
population size. In addition, we find that for a range of mutation rates, both
beneficial and deleterious mutations interfere and impede the adaptation
process in large populations. We also study the evolution of mutation rates in
adapting asexual populations, and conclude that linked beneficial mutations
have a stronger influence on mutator fixation than the deleterious mutations.

"  In extreme cold weather, living organisms produce Antifreeze Proteins (AFPs)
to counter the otherwise lethal intracellular formation of ice. Structures and
sequences of various AFPs exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, consequently
the prediction of the AFPs is considered to be a challenging task. In this
research, we propose to handle this arduous manifold learning task using the
notion of localized processing. In particular an AFP sequence is segmented into
two sub-segments each of which is analyzed for amino acid and di-peptide
compositions. We propose to use only the most significant features using the
concept of information gain (IG) followed by a random forest classification
approach. The proposed RAFP-Pred achieved an excellent performance on a number
of standard datasets. We report a high Youden's index
(sensitivity+specificity-1) value of 0.75 on the standard independent test data
set outperforming the AFP-PseAAC, AFP\_PSSM, AFP-Pred and iAFP by a margin of
0.05, 0.06, 0.14 and 0.68 respectively. The verification rate on the UniProKB
dataset is found to be 83.19\% which is substantially superior to the 57.18\%
reported for the iAFP method.

"  Uncovering modular structure in networks is fundamental for systems in
biology, physics, and engineering. Community detection identifies candidate
modules as hypotheses, which then need to be validated through experiments,
such as mutagenesis in a biological laboratory. Only a few communities can
typically be validated, and it is thus important to prioritize which
communities to select for downstream experimentation. Here we develop CRank, a
mathematically principled approach for prioritizing network communities. CRank
efficiently evaluates robustness and magnitude of structural features of each
community and then combines these features into the community prioritization.
CRank can be used with any community detection method. It needs only
information provided by the network structure and does not require any
additional metadata or labels. However, when available, CRank can incorporate
domain-specific information to further boost performance. Experiments on many
large networks show that CRank effectively prioritizes communities, yielding a
nearly 50-fold improvement in community prioritization.

"  Neural networks are commonly trained to make predictions through learning
algorithms. Contrastive Hebbian learning, which is a powerful rule inspired by
gradient backpropagation, is based on Hebb's rule and the contrastive
divergence algorithm. It operates in two phases, the forward (or free) phase,
where the data are fed to the network, and a backward (or clamped) phase, where
the target signals are clamped to the output layer of the network and the
feedback signals are transformed through the transpose synaptic weight
matrices. This implies symmetries at the synaptic level, for which there is no
evidence in the brain. In this work, we propose a new variant of the algorithm,
called random contrastive Hebbian learning, which does not rely on any synaptic
weights symmetries. Instead, it uses random matrices to transform the feedback
signals during the clamped phase, and the neural dynamics are described by
first order non-linear differential equations. The algorithm is experimentally
verified by solving a Boolean logic task, classification tasks (handwritten
digits and letters), and an autoencoding task. This article also shows how the
parameters affect learning, especially the random matrices. We use the
pseudospectra analysis to investigate further how random matrices impact the
learning process. Finally, we discuss the biological plausibility of the
proposed algorithm, and how it can give rise to better computational models for
learning.

"  The motility mechanism of certain rod-shaped bacteria has long been a
mystery, since no external appendages are involved in their motion which is
known as gliding. However, the physical principles behind gliding motility
still remain poorly understood. Using myxobacteria as a canonical example of
such organisms, we identify here the physical principles behind gliding
motility, and develop a theoretical model that predicts a two-regime behavior
of the gliding speed as a function of the substrate stiffness. Our theory
describes the elastic, viscous, and capillary interactions between the
bacterial membrane carrying a traveling wave, the secreted slime acting as a
lubricating film, and the substrate which we model as a soft solid. Defining
the myxobacterial gliding as the horizontal motion on the substrate under zero
net force, we find the two-regime behavior is due to two different mechanisms
of motility thrust. On stiff substrates, the thrust arises from the bacterial
shape deformations creating a flow of slime that exerts a pressure along the
bacterial length. This pressure in conjunction with the bacterial shape
provides the necessary thrust for propulsion. However, we show that such a
mechanism cannot lead to gliding on very soft substrates. Instead, we show that
capillary effects lead to the formation of a ridge at the slime-substrate-air
interface, which creates a thrust in the form of a localized pressure gradient
at the tip of the bacteria. To test our theory, we perform experiments with
isolated cells on agar substrates of varying stiffness and find the measured
gliding speeds to be in good agreement with the predictions from our
elasto-capillary-hydrodynamic model. The physical mechanisms reported here
serve as an important step towards an accurate theory of friction and
substrate-mediated interaction between bacteria in a swarm of cells
proliferating in soft media.
"
"  Intracellular bidirectional transport of cargo on Microtubule filaments is
achieved by the collective action of oppositely directed dynein and kinesin
motors. Experimental investigations probing the nature of bidirectional
transport have found that in certain cases, inhibiting the activity of one type
of motor results in an overall decline in the motility of the cellular cargo in
both directions. This somewhat counter-intuitive observation, referred to as
paradox of codependence is inconsistent with the existing paradigm of a
mechanistic tug-of-war between oppositely directed motors. Existing theoretical
models do not take into account a key difference in the functionality of
kinesin and dynein. Unlike kinesin, dynein motors exhibit catchbonding, wherein
the unbinding rates of these motors from the filaments are seen to decrease
with increasing force on them. Incorporating this catchbonding behavior of
dynein in a theoretical model and using experimentally relevant measures
characterizing cargo transport, we show that the functional divergence of the
two motors species manifests itself as an internal regulatory mechanism for
bidirectional transport and resolves the paradox of codependence. Our model
reproduces the key experimental features in appropriate parameter regimes and
provides an unifying framework for bidirectional cargo transport.
"
"  Cell division timing is critical for cell fate specification and
morphogenesis during embryogenesis. How division timings are regulated among
cells during development is poorly understood. Here we focus on the comparison
of asynchrony of division between sister cells (ADS) between wild-type and
mutant individuals of Caenorhabditis elegans. Since the replicate number of
mutant individuals of each mutated gene, usually one, is far smaller than that
of wild-type, direct comparison of two distributions of ADS between wild-type
and mutant type, such as Kolmogorov- Smirnov test, is not feasible. On the
other hand, we find that sometimes ADS is correlated with the life span of
corresponding mother cell in wild-type. Hence, we apply a semiparametric
Bayesian quantile regression method to estimate the 95% confidence interval
curve of ADS with respect to life span of mother cell of wild-type individuals.
Then, mutant-type ADSs outside the corresponding confidence interval are
selected out as abnormal one with a significance level of 0.05. Simulation
study demonstrates the accuracy of our method and Gene Enrichment Analysis
validates the results of real data sets.
"
"  Automated classification methods for disease diagnosis are currently in the
limelight, especially for imaging data. Classification does not fully meet a
clinician's needs, however: in order to combine the results of multiple tests
and decide on a course of treatment, a clinician needs the likelihood of a
given health condition rather than binary classification yielded by such
methods. We illustrate how likelihoods can be derived step by step from first
principles and approximations, and how they can be assessed and selected,
illustrating our approach using fMRI data from a publicly available data set
containing schizophrenic and healthy control subjects. We start from the basic
assumption of partial exchangeability, and then the notion of sufficient
statistics and the ""method of translation"" (Edgeworth, 1898) combined with
conjugate priors. This method can be used to construct a likelihood that can be
used to compare different data-reduction algorithms. Despite the
simplifications and possibly unrealistic assumptions used to illustrate the
method, we obtain classification results comparable to previous, more realistic
studies about schizophrenia, whilst yielding likelihoods that can naturally be
combined with the results of other diagnostic tests.
"
"  Neuronal correlates of Parkinson's disease (PD) include a slowing of the
electroencephalogram (EEG) and enhanced synchrony at 3-7 and 7-30 Hz in the
basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex. This study describes the dynamics of a
physiologically based mean-field model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical
system, and shows how it accounts for key electrophysiological correlates of
PD. Its connectivity comprises partially segregated direct and indirect
pathways through the striatum, a hyperdirect pathway involving a
corticosubthalamic projection, thalamostriatal feedback, and local inhibition
in striatum and external pallidum (GPe). In a companion paper, realistic
steady-state firing rates were obtained for the healthy state, and after
dopamine loss modeled by weaker direct and stronger indirect pathways, reduced
intrapallidal inhibition, lower firing thresholds of the GPe and subthalamic
nucleus (STN), a stronger striato-GPe projection, and weaker cortical
interactions. Here we show that oscillations around 5 and 20 Hz can arise with
a strong indirect pathway, which also increases synchrony throughout the basal
ganglia. Further, increased theta power with nigrostriatal degeneration
correlates with reduced alpha power and peak frequency, matching experiments.
Unlike the hyperdirect pathway, the indirect pathway sustains oscillations with
realistic phase relationships. Changes in basal ganglia responses to transient
stimuli accord with experimental data. Reduced cortical gains due to both
nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine loss lead to slower cortical activity
changes and may be related to bradykinesia. Finally, increased EEG power found
in some studies may be partly explained by a lower effective GPe firing
threshold, reduced GPe-GPe inhibition, and/or weaker intracortical connections
in PD. Strict separation of the direct and indirect pathways is not necessary
for these results.
"
"  The effective representation of proteins is a crucial task that directly
affects the performance of many bioinformatics problems. Related proteins
usually bind to similar ligands. Chemical characteristics of ligands are known
to capture the functional and mechanistic properties of proteins suggesting
that a ligand based approach can be utilized in protein representation. In this
study, we propose SMILESVec, a SMILES-based method to represent ligands and a
novel method to compute similarity of proteins by describing them based on
their ligands. The proteins are defined utilizing the word-embeddings of the
SMILES strings of their ligands. The performance of the proposed protein
description method is evaluated in protein clustering task using TransClust and
MCL algorithms. Two other protein representation methods that utilize protein
sequence, BLAST and ProtVec, and two compound fingerprint based protein
representation methods are compared. We showed that ligand-based protein
representation, which uses only SMILES strings of the ligands that proteins
bind to, performs as well as protein-sequence based representation methods in
protein clustering. The results suggest that ligand-based protein description
can be an alternative to the traditional sequence or structure based
representation of proteins and this novel approach can be applied to different
bioinformatics problems such as prediction of new protein-ligand interactions
and protein function annotation.

"  How is reliable physiological function maintained in cells despite
considerable variability in the values of key parameters of multiple
interacting processes that govern that function? Here we use the classic
Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the squid giant axon action potential to propose
a possible approach to this problem. Although the full Hodgkin-Huxley model is
very sensitive to fluctuations that independently occur in its many parameters,
the outcome is in fact determined by simple combinations of these parameters
along two physiological dimensions: Structural and Kinetic (denoted $S$ and
$K$). Structural parameters describe the properties of the cell, including its
capacitance and the densities of its ion channels. Kinetic parameters are those
that describe the opening and closing of the voltage-dependent conductances.
The impacts of parametric fluctuations on the dynamics of the system, seemingly
complex in the high dimensional representation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, are
tractable when examined within the $S-K$ plane. We demonstrate that slow
inactivation, a ubiquitous activity-dependent feature of ionic channels, is a
powerful local homeostatic control mechanism that stabilizes excitability amid
changes in structural and kinetic parameters.

"  The aetiology of polygenic obesity is multifactorial, which indicates that
life-style and environmental factors may influence multiples genes to aggravate
this disorder. Several low-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
been associated with BMI. However, identified loci only explain a small
proportion of the variation ob-served for this phenotype. The linear nature of
genome wide association studies (GWAS) used to identify associations between
genetic variants and the phenotype have had limited success in explaining the
heritability variation of BMI and shown low predictive capacity in
classification studies. GWAS ignores the epistatic interactions that less
significant variants have on the phenotypic outcome. In this paper we utilise a
novel deep learning-based methodology to reduce the high dimensional space in
GWAS and find epistatic interactions between SNPs for classification purposes.
SNPs were filtered based on the effects associations have with BMI. Since
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing is highly conservative, an important
proportion of SNPs involved in SNP-SNP interactions are ignored. Therefore,
only SNPs with p-values < 1x10-2 were considered for subsequent epistasis
analysis using stacked auto encoders (SAE). This allows the nonlinearity
present in SNP-SNP interactions to be discovered through progressively smaller
hidden layer units and to initialise a multi-layer feedforward artificial
neural network (ANN) classifier. The classifier is fine-tuned to classify
extremely obese and non-obese individuals. The best results were obtained with
2000 compressed units (SE=0.949153, SP=0.933014, Gini=0.949936,
Lo-gloss=0.1956, AUC=0.97497 and MSE=0.054057). Using 50 compressed units it
was possible to achieve (SE=0.785311, SP=0.799043, Gini=0.703566,
Logloss=0.476864, AUC=0.85178 and MSE=0.156315).

"  Fishing activities have broad impacts that affect, although not exclusively,
the targeted stocks. These impacts affect predators and prey of the harvested
species, as well as the whole ecosystem it inhabits. Ecosystem models can be
used to study the interactions that occur within a system, including those
between different organisms and those between fisheries and targeted species.
Trophic web models like Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) can handle fishing fleets as
a top predator, with top-down impact on harvested organisms. The aim of this
study was to better understand the Icelandic marine ecosystem and the
interactions within. This was done by constructing an EwE model of Icelandic
waters. The model was run from 1984 to 2013 and was fitted to time series of
biomass estimates, landings data and mean annual temperature. The final model
was chosen by selecting the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion.
A skill assessment was performed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient,
the coefficient of determination, the modelling efficiency and the reliability
index to evaluate the model performance. The model performed satisfactorily
when simulating previously estimated biomass and known landings. Most of the
groups with time series were estimated to have top-down control over their
prey. These are harvested species with direct and/or indirect links to lower
trophic levels and future fishing policies should take this into account. This
model could be used as a tool to investigate how such policies could impact the
marine ecosystem in Icelandic waters.
"
"  The famous ""two-fold cost of sex"" is really the cost of anisogamy -- why
should females mate with males who do not contribute resources to offspring,
rather than isogamous partners who contribute equally? In typical anisogamous
populations, a single very fit male can have an enormous number of offspring,
far larger than is possible for any female or isogamous individual. If the
sexual selection on males aligns with the natural selection on females,
anisogamy thus allows much more rapid adaptation via super-successful males. We
show via simulations that this effect can be sufficient to overcome the
two-fold cost and maintain anisogamy against isogamy in populations adapting to
environmental change. The key quantity is the variance in male fitness -- if
this exceeds what is possible in an isogamous population, anisogamous
populations can win out in direct competition by adapting faster.

"  We introduce KiNetX, a fully automated meta-algorithm for the kinetic
analysis of complex chemical reaction networks derived from semi-accurate but
efficient electronic structure calculations. It is designed to (i) accelerate
the automated exploration of such networks, and (ii) cope with model-inherent
errors in electronic structure calculations on elementary reaction steps. We
developed and implemented KiNetX to possess three features. First, KiNetX
evaluates the kinetic relevance of every species in a (yet incomplete) reaction
network to confine the search for new elementary reaction steps only to those
species that are considered possibly relevant. Second, KiNetX identifies and
eliminates all kinetically irrelevant species and elementary reactions to
reduce a complex network graph to a comprehensible mechanism. Third, KiNetX
estimates the sensitivity of species concentrations toward changes in
individual rate constants (derived from relative free energies), which allows
us to systematically select the most efficient electronic structure model for
each elementary reaction given a predefined accuracy. The novelty of KiNetX
consists in the rigorous propagation of correlated free-energy uncertainty
through all steps of our kinetic analyis. To examine the performance of KiNetX,
we developed AutoNetGen. It semirandomly generates chemistry-mimicking reaction
networks by encoding chemical logic into their underlying graph structure.
AutoNetGen allows us to consider a vast number of distinct chemistry-like
scenarios and, hence, to discuss assess the importance of rigorous uncertainty
propagation in a statistical context. Our results reveal that KiNetX reliably
supports the deduction of product ratios, dominant reaction pathways, and
possibly other network properties from semi-accurate electronic structure data.

"  In biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) research, the Loreau-Hector
(LH) statistical scheme is widely-used to partition the effect of biodiversity
on ecosystem properties into a ""complementarity effect"" and a ""selection
effect"". This selection effect was originally considered analogous to the
selection term in the Price equation from evolutionary biology. However, a key
paper published over thirteen years ago challenged this interpretation by
devising a new tripartite partitioning scheme that purportedly quantified the
role of selection in biodiversity experiments more accurately. This tripartite
method, as well as its recent spatiotemporal extension, were both developed as
an attempt to apply the Price equation in a BEF context. Here, we demonstrate
that the derivation of this tripartite method, as well as its spatiotemporal
extension, involve a set of incoherent and nonsensical mathematical arguments
driven largely by naïve visual analogies with the original Price equation,
that result in neither partitioning scheme quantifying any real property in the
natural world. Furthermore, we show that Loreau and Hector's original selection
effect always represented a true analog of the original Price selection term,
making the tripartite partitioning scheme a nonsensical solution to a
non-existent problem [...]

"  Avian Influenza breakouts cause millions of dollars in damage each year
globally, especially in Asian countries such as China and South Korea. The
impact magnitude of a breakout directly correlates to time required to fully
understand the influenza virus, particularly the interspecies pathogenicity.
The procedure requires laboratory tests that require resources typically
lacking in a breakout emergency. In this study, we propose new quantitative
methods utilizing machine learning and deep learning to correctly classify host
species given raw DNA sequence data of the influenza virus, and provide
probabilities for each classification. The best deep learning models achieve
top-1 classification accuracy of 47%, and top-3 classification accuracy of 82%,
on a dataset of 11 host species classes.

"  In a recent study entitled ""Cell nuclei have lower refractive index and mass
density than cytoplasm"", we provided strong evidence indicating that the
nuclear refractive index (RI) is lower than the RI of the cytoplasm for several
cell lines. In a complementary study in 2017, entitled ""Is the nuclear
refractive index lower than cytoplasm? Validation of phase measurements and
implications for light scattering technologies"", Steelman et al. observed a
lower nuclear RI also for other cell lines and ruled out methodological error
sources such as phase wrapping and scattering effects. Recently, Yurkin
composed a comment on these 2 publications, entitled ""How a phase image of a
cell with nucleus refractive index smaller than that of the cytoplasm should
look like?"", putting into question the methods used for measuring the cellular
and nuclear RI in the aforementioned publications by suggesting that a lower
nuclear RI would produce a characteristic dip in the measured phase profile in
situ. We point out the difficulty of identifying this dip in the presence of
other cell organelles, noise, or blurring due to the imaging point spread
function. Furthermore, we mitigate Yurkin's concerns regarding the ability of
the simple-transmission approximation to compare cellular and nuclear RI by
analyzing a set of phase images with a novel, scattering-based approach. We
conclude that the absence of a characteristic dip in the measured phase
profiles does not contradict the usage of the simple-transmission approximation
for the determination of the average cellular or nuclear RI. Our response can
be regarded as an addition to the response by Steelman, Eldridge and Wax. We
kindly ask the reader to attend to their thorough ascertainment prior to
reading our response.

"  Modeling and interpreting spike train data is a task of central importance in
computational neuroscience, with significant translational implications. Two
popular classes of data-driven models for this task are autoregressive Point
Process Generalized Linear models (PPGLM) and latent State-Space models (SSM)
with point-process observations. In this letter, we derive a mathematical
connection between these two classes of models. By introducing an auxiliary
history process, we represent exactly a PPGLM in terms of a latent, infinite
dimensional dynamical system, which can then be mapped onto an SSM by basis
function projections and moment closure. This representation provides a new
perspective on widely used methods for modeling spike data, and also suggests
novel algorithmic approaches to fitting such models. We illustrate our results
on a phasic bursting neuron model, showing that our proposed approach provides
an accurate and efficient way to capture neural dynamics.

"  One of the big restrictions in brain computer interface field is the very
limited training samples, it is difficult to build a reliable and usable system
with such limited data. Inspired by generative adversarial networks, we propose
a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial (cDCGAN) Networks
method to generate more artificial EEG signal automatically for data
augmentation to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks in
brain computer interface field and overcome the small training dataset
problems. We evaluate the proposed cDCGAN method on BCI competition dataset of
motor imagery. The results show that the generated artificial EEG data from
Gaussian noise can learn the features from raw EEG data and has no less than
the classification accuracy of raw EEG data in the testing dataset. Also by
using generated artificial data can effectively improve classification accuracy
at the same model with limited training data.

"  The metric space of phylogenetic trees defined by Billera, Holmes, and
Vogtmann, which we refer to as BHV space, provides a natural geometric setting
for describing collections of trees on the same set of taxa. However, it is
sometimes necessary to analyze collections of trees on non-identical taxa sets
(i.e., with different numbers of leaves), and in this context it is not evident
how to apply BHV space. Davidson et al. recently approached this problem by
describing a combinatorial algorithm extending tree topologies to regions in
higher dimensional tree spaces, so that one can quickly compute which
topologies contain a given tree as partial data. In this paper, we refine and
adapt their algorithm to work for metric trees to give a full characterization
of the subspace of extensions of a subtree. We describe how to apply our
algorithm to define and search a space of possible supertrees and, for a
collection of tree fragments with different leaf sets, to measure their
compatibility.

"  Bacterial DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoils into chromosomal DNA and
relaxes positive supercoils introduced by replication and transiently by
transcription. Removal of these positive supercoils is essential for
replication fork progression and for the overall unlinking of the two duplex
DNA strands, as well as for ongoing transcription. To address how gyrase copes
with these topological challenges, we used high-speed single-molecule
fluorescence imaging in live Escherichia coli cells. We demonstrate that at
least 300 gyrase molecules are stably bound to the chromosome at any time, with
~12 enzymes enriched near each replication fork. Trapping of reaction
intermediates with ciprofloxacin revealed complexes undergoing catalysis. Dwell
times of ~2 s were observed for the dispersed gyrase molecules, which we
propose maintain steady-state levels of negative supercoiling of the
chromosome. In contrast, the dwell time of replisome-proximal molecules was ~8
s, consistent with these catalyzing processive positive supercoil relaxation in
front of the progressing replisome.

"  Making an informed, correct and quick decision can be life-saving. It's
crucial for animals during an escape behaviour or for autonomous cars during
driving. The decision can be complex and may involve an assessment of the
amount of threats present and the nature of each threat. Thus, we should expect
early sensory processing to supply classification information fast and
accurately, even before relying the information to higher brain areas or more
complex system components downstream. Today, advanced convolutional artificial
neural networks can successfully solve visual detection and classification
tasks and are commonly used to build complex decision making systems. However,
in order to perform well on these tasks they require increasingly complex,
""very deep"" model structure, which is costly in inference run-time, energy
consumption and number of training samples, only trainable on cloud-computing
clusters. A single spiking neuron has been shown to be able to solve
recognition tasks for homogeneous Poisson input statistics, a commonly used
model for spiking activity in the neocortex. When modeled as leaky integrate
and fire with gradient decent learning algorithm it was shown to posses a
variety of complex computational capabilities. Here we improve its
implementation. We also account for more natural stimulus generated inputs that
deviate from this homogeneous Poisson spiking. The improved gradient-based
local learning rule allows for significantly better and stable generalization.
We also show that with its improved capabilities it can count weakly labeled
concepts by applying our model to a problem of multiple instance learning (MIL)
with counting where labels are only available for collections of concepts. In
this counting MNIST task the neuron exploits the improved implementation and
outperforms conventional ConvNet architecture under similar condtions.

"  Chemical evolution is essential in understanding the origins of life. We
present a theory for the evolution of molecule masses and show that small
molecules grow by random diffusion and large molecules by a preferential
attachment process leading eventually to life's molecules. It reproduces
correctly the distribution of molecules found via mass spectroscopy for the
Murchison meteorite and estimates the start of chemical evolution back to 12.8
billion years following the birth of stars and supernovae. From the Frontier
mass between the random and preferential attachment dynamics the birth time of
molecule families can be estimated. Amino acids emerge about 165 million years
after the start of evolution. Using the scaling of reaction rates with the
distance of the molecules in space we recover correctly the few days emergence
time of amino acids in the Miller-Urey experiment. The distribution of
interstellar and extragalactic molecules are both consistent with the
evolutionary mass distribution, and their age is estimated to 108 and 65
million years after the start of evolution. From the model, we can determine
the number of different molecule compositions at the time of the creation of
Earth to be 1.6 million and the number of molecule compositions in interstellar
space to a mere 719.

"  The stability of a complex system generally decreases with increasing system
size and interconnectivity, a counterintuitive result of widespread importance
across the physical, life, and social sciences. Despite recent interest in the
relationship between system properties and stability, the effect of variation
in the response rate of individual system components remains unconsidered. Here
I vary the component response rates ($\boldsymbol{\gamma}$) of randomly
generated complex systems. I show that when component response rates vary, the
potential for system stability is markedly increased. Variation in
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ becomes increasingly important as system size increases,
such that the largest stable complex systems would be unstable if not for
$\boldsymbol{Var(\gamma)}$. My results reveal a previously unconsidered driver
of system stability that is likely to be pervasive across all complex systems.

"  Accurate protein structural ensembles can be determined with metainference, a
Bayesian inference method that integrates experimental information with prior
knowledge of the system and deals with all sources of uncertainty and errors as

study of complex biological systems requiring extensive conformational
sampling. In this chapter, we provide a step-by-step guide to perform and
analyse metadynamic metainference simulations using the ISDB module of the
open-source PLUMED library, as well as a series of practical tips to avoid
common mistakes. Specifically, we will guide the reader in the process of

"  The functional significance of resting state networks and their abnormal
manifestations in psychiatric disorders are firmly established, as is the
importance of the cortical rhythms in mediating these networks. Resting state
networks are known to undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to
adulthood, but whether distinct cortical rhythms, which are generated by
separable neural mechanisms and are often manifested abnormally in psychiatric
conditions, mediate maturation differentially, remains unknown. Using
magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map frequency band specific maturation of
resting state networks from age 7 to 29 in 162 participants (31 independent),
we found significant changes with age in networks mediated by the beta
(13-30Hz) and gamma (31-80Hz) bands. More specifically, gamma band mediated
networks followed an expected asymptotic trajectory, but beta band mediated
networks followed a linear trajectory. Network integration increased with age
in gamma band mediated networks, while local segregation increased with age in
beta band mediated networks. Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance
with age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with
those that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks.
These findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of
cortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.

"  Delays are an important phenomenon arising in a wide variety of real world
systems. They occur in biological models because of diffusion effects or as
simplifying modeling elements. We propose here to consider delayed stochastic
reaction networks. The difficulty here lies in the fact that the state-space of
a delayed reaction network is infinite-dimensional, which makes their analysis
more involved. We demonstrate here that a particular class of stochastic
time-varying delays, namely those that follow a phase-type distribution, can be
exactly implemented in terms of a chemical reaction network. Hence, any
delay-free network can be augmented to incorporate those delays through the
addition of delay-species and delay-reactions. Hence, for this class of
stochastic delays, which can be used to approximate any delay distribution
arbitrarily accurately, the state-space remains finite-dimensional and,
therefore, standard tools developed for standard reaction network still apply.
In particular, we demonstrate that for unimolecular mass-action reaction
networks that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if
the non-delayed network is ergodic as well. Bimolecular reactions are more
difficult to consider but an analogous result is also obtained. These results
tell us that delays that are phase-type distributed, regardless of their
distribution, are not harmful to the ergodicity property of reaction networks.
We also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the
moment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared
to the delay-free case. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed
stochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is
considered. It is proven that this controller achieves its goal provided that
the delay-free network satisfy the conditions of ergodicity and
output-controllability.

"  The impact of developmental and aging processes on brain connectivity and the
connectome has been widely studied. Network theoretical measures and certain
topological principles are computed from the entire brain, however there is a
need to separate and understand the underlying subnetworks which contribute
towards these observed holistic connectomic alterations. One organizational
principle is the rich-club - a core subnetwork of brain regions that are
strongly connected, forming a high-cost, high-capacity backbone that is
critical for effective communication in the network. Investigations primarily
focus on its alterations with disease and age. Here, we present a systematic
analysis of not only the rich-club, but also other subnetworks derived from
this backbone - namely feeder and seeder subnetworks. Our analysis is applied
to structural connectomes in a normal cohort from a large, publicly available
lifespan study. We demonstrate changes in rich-club membership with age
alongside a shift in importance from 'peripheral' seeder to feeder subnetworks.
Our results show a refinement within the rich-club structure (increase in
transitivity and betweenness centrality), as well as increased efficiency in
the feeder subnetwork and decreased measures of network integration and
segregation in the seeder subnetwork. These results demonstrate the different
developmental patterns when analyzing the connectome stratified according to
its rich-club and the potential of utilizing this subnetwork analysis to reveal
the evolution of brain architectural alterations across the life-span.

"  Cyclization of DNA with sticky ends is commonly used to construct DNA
minicircles and to measure DNA bendability. The cyclization probability of
short DNA (< 150 bp) has a strong length dependence, but how it depends on the
rotational positioning of the sticky ends around the helical axis is less
clear. To shed light upon the determinants of the cyclization probability of
short DNA, we measured cyclization and decyclization rates of ~100-bp DNA with
sticky ends over two helical periods using single-molecule Fluorescence
Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The cyclization rate increases monotonically
with length, indicating no excess twisting, while the decyclization rate
oscillates with length, higher at half-integer helical turns and lower at
integer helical turns. The oscillation profile is kinetically and
thermodynamically consistent with a three-state cyclization model in which
sticky-ended short DNA first bends into a torsionally-relaxed teardrop, and
subsequently transitions to a more stable loop upon terminal base stacking. We
also show that the looping probability density (the J factor) extracted from
this study is in good agreement with the worm-like chain model near 100 bp. For
shorter DNA, we discuss various experimental factors that prevent an accurate
measurement of the J factor.
"
"  Decades of research on the neural code underlying spatial navigation have
revealed a diverse set of neural response properties. The Entorhinal Cortex
(EC) of the mammalian brain contains a rich set of spatial correlates,
including grid cells which encode space using tessellating patterns. However,
the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations
remain largely mysterious. As a new way to understand these neural
representations, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform
navigation tasks in 2D arenas based on velocity inputs. Surprisingly, we find
that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with
units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and
band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been
observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border
cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies.
Together, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as
observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently
given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.

"  Unlike other organs, the thymus and gonads generate non-uniform cell
populations, many members of which perish, and a few survive. While it is
recognized that thymic cells are 'audited' to optimize an organism's immune
repertoire, whether gametogenesis could be orchestrated similarly to favour
high quality gametes is uncertain. Ideally, such quality would be affirmed at
early stages before the commitment of extensive parental resources. A case is
here made that, along the lines of a previously proposed lymphocyte quality
control mechanism, gamete quality can be registered indirectly through
detection of incompatibilities between proteins encoded by the grandparental
DNA sequences within the parent from which haploid gametes are meiotically
derived. This 'stress test' is achieved in the same way that thymic screening
for potential immunological incompatibilities is achieved - by 'promiscuous'
expression, under the influence of the AIRE protein, of the products of genes
that are not normally specific for that organ. Consistent with this, the Aire
gene is expressed in both thymus and gonads, and AIRE deficiency impedes
function in both organs. While not excluding the subsequent emergence of hybrid
incompatibilities due to the intermixing of genomic sequences from parents
(rather than grandparents), many observations, such as the number of proteins
that are aberrantly expressed during gametogenesis, can be explained on this
basis. Indeed, promiscuous expression could have first evolved in
gamete-forming cells where incompatible proteins would be manifest as aberrant
protein aggregates that cause apoptosis. This mechanism would later have been
co-opted by thymic epithelial cells which display peptides from aggregates to
remove potentially autoreactive T cells.

"  A dynamic self-organized morphology is the hallmark of network-shaped
organisms like slime moulds and fungi. Organisms continuously re-organize their
flexible, undifferentiated body plans to forage for food. Among these organisms
the slime mould Physarum polycephalum has emerged as a model to investigate how
organism can self-organize their extensive networks and act as a coordinated
whole. Cytoplasmic fluid flows flowing through the tubular networks have been
identified as key driver of morphological dynamics. Inquiring how fluid flows
can shape living matter from small to large scales opens up many new avenues
for research.

"  While there has been an explosion in the number of experimentally determined,
atomically detailed structures of proteins, how to represent these structures
in a machine learning context remains an open research question. In this work
we demonstrate that representations learned from raw atomic coordinates can
outperform hand-engineered structural features while displaying a much higher
degree of transferrability. To do so, we focus on a central problem in biology:
predicting how proteins interact with one another--that is, which surfaces of
one protein bind to which surfaces of another protein. We present Siamese
Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet), the first end-to-end learning method for
protein interface prediction. Despite using only spatial coordinates and
identities of atoms as inputs, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods that
rely on hand-engineered, high-level features. These results are particularly
striking because we train the method entirely on a significantly biased data
set that does not account for the fact that proteins deform when binding to one
another. Demonstrating the first successful application of transfer learning to
atomic-level data, our network maintains high performance, without retraining,
when tested on real cases in which proteins do deform.
"
"  Whereas the relationship between criticality of gene regulatory networks
(GRNs) and dynamics of GRNs at a single cell level has been vigorously studied,
the relationship between the criticality of GRNs and system properties at a
higher level has remained unexplored. Here we aim at revealing a potential role
of criticality of GRNs at a multicellular level which are hard to uncover
through the single-cell-level studies, especially from an evolutionary
viewpoint. Our model simulated the growth of a cell population from a single
seed cell. All the cells were assumed to have identical GRNs. We induced
genetic perturbations to the GRN of the seed cell by adding, deleting, or
switching a regulatory link between a pair of genes. From numerical
simulations, we found that the criticality of GRNs facilitated the formation of
nontrivial morphologies when the GRNs were critical in the presence of the
evolutionary perturbations. Moreover, the criticality of GRNs produced
topologically homogenous cell clusters by adjusting the spatial arrangements of
cells, which led to the formation of nontrivial morphogenetic patterns. Our
findings corresponded to an epigenetic viewpoint that heterogeneous and complex
features emerge from homogeneous and less complex components through the
interactions among them. Thus, our results imply that highly structured tissues
or organs in morphogenesis of multicellular organisms might stem from the
criticality of GRNs.

"  Feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently
state-of-the-art for object classification tasks such as ImageNet. Further,
they are quantitatively accurate models of temporally-averaged responses of
neurons in the primate brain's visual system. However, biological visual
systems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical
CNNs: local recurrence within cortical areas, and long-range feedback from
downstream areas to upstream areas. Here we explored the role of recurrence in
improving classification performance. We found that standard forms of
recurrence (vanilla RNNs and LSTMs) do not perform well within deep CNNs on the
ImageNet task. In contrast, novel cells that incorporated two structural
features, bypassing and gating, were able to boost task accuracy substantially.
We extended these design principles in an automated search over thousands of
model architectures, which identified novel local recurrent cells and
long-range feedback connections useful for object recognition. Moreover, these
task-optimized ConvRNNs matched the dynamics of neural activity in the primate
visual system better than feedforward networks, suggesting a role for the
brain's recurrent connections in performing difficult visual behaviors.
"
"  Dynamic patterning of specific proteins is essential for the spatiotemporal
regulation of many important intracellular processes in procaryotes,
eucaryotes, and multicellular organisms. The emergence of patterns generated by
interactions of diffusing proteins is a paradigmatic example for
self-organization. In this article we review quantitative models for
intracellular Min protein patterns in E. coli, Cdc42 polarization in S.
cerevisiae, and the bipolar PAR protein patterns found in C. elegans. By
analyzing the molecular processes driving these systems we derive a theoretical
perspective on general principles underlying self-organized pattern formation.
We argue that intracellular pattern formation is not captured by concepts such
as ""activators""', ""inhibitors"", or ""substrate-depletion"". Instead,
intracellular pattern formation is based on the redistribution of proteins by
cytosolic diffusion, and the cycling of proteins between distinct
conformational states. Therefore, mass-conserving reaction-diffusion equations
provide the most appropriate framework to study intracellular pattern
formation. We conclude that directed transport, e.g. cytosolic diffusion along
an actively maintained cytosolic gradient, is the key process underlying
pattern formation. Thus the basic principle of self-organization is the
establishment and maintenance of directed transport by intracellular protein
dynamics.
"
"  The formation of self-organized patterns is key to the morphogenesis of
multicellular organisms, although a comprehensive theory of biological pattern
formation is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model combining tissue
mechanics to morphogen turnover and transport in order to explore new routes to
patterning. Our active description couples morphogen reaction-diffusion, which
impact on cell differentiation and tissue mechanics, to a two-phase poroelastic
rheology, where one tissue phase consists of a poroelastic cell network and the
other of a permeating extracellular fluid, which provides a feedback by
actively transporting morphogens. While this model encompasses previous
theories approximating tissues to inert monophasic media, such as Turing's
reaction-diffusion model, it overcomes some of their key limitations permitting
pattern formation via any two-species biochemical kinetics thanks to
mechanically induced cross-diffusion flows. Moreover, we describe a
qualitatively different advection-driven Keller-Segel instability which allows
for the formation of patterns with a single morphogen, and whose fundamental
mode pattern robustly scales with tissue size. We discuss the potential
relevance of these findings for tissue morphogenesis.

"  Neuroinflammation in utero may result in lifelong neurological disabilities.
Astrocytes play a pivotal role, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. No
early postnatal treatment strategies exist to enhance neuroprotective potential
of astrocytes. We hypothesized that agonism on {\alpha}7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor ({\alpha}7nAChR) in fetal astrocytes will augment their
neuroprotective transcriptome profile, while the antagonistic stimulation of
{\alpha}7nAChR will achieve the opposite. Using an in vivo - in vitro model of
developmental programming of neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), we validated this hypothesis in primary fetal sheep astrocytes cultures
re-exposed to LPS in presence of a selective {\alpha}7nAChR agonist or
antagonist. Our RNAseq findings show that a pro-inflammatory astrocyte
transcriptome phenotype acquired in vitro by LPS stimulation is reversed with
{\alpha}7nAChR agonistic stimulation. Conversely, antagonistic {\alpha}7nAChR
stimulation potentiates the pro-inflammatory astrocytic transcriptome
phenotype. Furthermore, we conduct a secondary transcriptome analysis against
the identical {\alpha}7nAChR experiments in fetal sheep primary microglia
cultures and against the Simons Simplex Collection for autism spectrum disorder
and discuss the implications.

"  The concentration of biochemical oxygen demand, BOD5, was studied in order to
evaluate the water quality of the Igapó I Lake, in Londrina, Paraná State,
Brazil. The simulation was conducted by means of the discretization in
curvilinear coordinates of the geometry of Igapó I Lake, together with finite
difference and finite element methods. The evaluation of the proposed numerical
model for water quality was performed by comparing the experimental values of
BOD5 with the numerical results. The evaluation of the model showed
quantitative results compatible with the actual behavior of Igapó I Lake in
relation to the simulated parameter. The qualitative analysis of the numerical
simulations provided a better understanding of the dynamics of the BOD5
concentration at Igapó I Lake, showing that such concentrations in the
central regions of the lake have values above those allowed by Brazilian law.
The results can help to guide choices by public officials, as: (i) improve the
identification mechanisms of pollutant emitters on Lake Igapó I, (ii)
contribute to the optimal treatment of the recovery of the polluted environment
and (iii) provide a better quality of life for the regulars of the lake as well
as for the residents living on the lakeside.

"  Since the largest 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa,
understanding of Ebola virus infection has improved, notably the involvement of
innate immune mediators. Amongst them, collectins are important players in the
antiviral innate immune defense. A screening of Ebola glycoprotein
(GP)-collectins interactions revealed the specific interaction of human
surfactant protein D (hSP-D), a lectin expressed in lung and liver, two
compartments where Ebola was found in vivo. Further analyses have demonstrated
an involvement of hSP-D in the enhancement of virus infection in several in
vitro models. Similar effects were observed for porcine SP-D (pSP-D). In
addition, both hSP-D and pSP-D interacted with Reston virus (RESTV) GP and
enhanced pseudoviral infection in pulmonary cells. Thus, our study reveals a
novel partner of Ebola GP that may participate to enhance viral spread.

"  We study weighted particle systems in which new generations are resampled
from current particles with probabilities proportional to their weights. This
covers a broad class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, widely-used in
applied statistics and cognate disciplines. We consider the genealogical tree
embedded into such particle systems, and identify conditions, as well as an
appropriate time-scaling, under which they converge to the Kingman n-coalescent
in the infinite system size limit in the sense of finite-dimensional
distributions. Thus, the tractable n-coalescent can be used to predict the
shape and size of SMC genealogies, as we illustrate by characterising the
limiting mean and variance of the tree height. SMC genealogies are known to be
connected to algorithm performance, so that our results are likely to have
applications in the design of new methods as well. Our conditions for
convergence are strong, but we show by simulation that they do not appear to be
necessary.

"  Large datasets represented by multidimensional data point clouds often
possess non-trivial distributions with branching trajectories and excluded
regions, with the recent single-cell transcriptomic studies of developing
embryo being notable examples. Reducing the complexity and producing compact
and interpretable representations of such data remains a challenging task. Most
of the existing computational methods are based on exploring the local data
point neighbourhood relations, a step that can perform poorly in the case of
multidimensional and noisy data. Here we present ElPiGraph, a scalable and
robust method for approximation of datasets with complex structures which does
not require computing the complete data distance matrix or the data point
neighbourhood graph. This method is able to withstand high levels of noise and
is capable of approximating complex topologies via principal graph ensembles
that can be combined into a consensus principal graph. ElPiGraph deals
efficiently with large and complex datasets in various fields from biology,
where it can be used to infer gene dynamics from single-cell RNA-Seq, to
astronomy, where it can be used to explore complex structures in the
distribution of galaxies.

"  Continuous cultures of mammalian cells are complex systems displaying
hallmark phenomena of nonlinear dynamics, such as multi-stability, hysteresis,
as well as sharp transitions between different metabolic states. In this
context mathematical models may suggest control strategies to steer the system
towards desired states. Although even clonal populations are known to exhibit
cell-to-cell variability, most of the currently studied models assume that the
population is homogeneous. To overcome this limitation, we use the maximum
entropy principle to model the phenotypic distribution of cells in a chemostat
as a function of the dilution rate. We consider the coupling between cell
metabolism and extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor
and take into account the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation on cell
viability. We present a formal solution for the stationary state of the
chemostat and show how to apply it in two examples. First, a simplified model
of cell metabolism where the exact solution is tractable, and then a
genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Along the way we discuss several consequences of heterogeneity, such as:
qualitative changes in the dynamical landscape of the system, increasing
concentrations of byproducts that vanish in the homogeneous case, and larger
population sizes.

"  Bazhin has analyzed ATP coupling in terms of quasiequilibrium states where
fast reactions have reached an approximate steady state while slow reactions
have not yet reached equilibrium. After an expository introduction to the
relevant aspects of reaction network theory, we review his work and explain the
role of emergent conserved quantities in coupling. These are quantities, left
unchanged by fast reactions, whose conservation forces exergonic processes such
as ATP hydrolysis to drive desired endergonic processes.

"  Neural responses in the cortex change over time both systematically, due to
ongoing plasticity and learning, and seemingly randomly, due to various sources
of noise and variability. Most previous work considered each of these
processes, learning and variability, in isolation -- here we study neural
networks exhibiting both and show that their interaction leads to the emergence
of powerful computational properties. We trained neural networks on classical
unsupervised learning tasks, in which the objective was to represent their
inputs in an efficient, easily decodable form, with an additional cost for
neural reliability which we derived from basic biophysical considerations. This
cost on reliability introduced a tradeoff between energetically cheap but
inaccurate representations and energetically costly but accurate ones. Despite
the learning tasks being non-probabilistic, the networks solved this tradeoff
by developing a probabilistic representation: neural variability represented
samples from statistically appropriate posterior distributions that would
result from performing probabilistic inference over their inputs. We provide an
analytical understanding of this result by revealing a connection between the
cost of reliability, and the objective for a state-of-the-art Bayesian
inference strategy: variational autoencoders. We show that the same cost leads
to the emergence of increasingly accurate probabilistic representations as
networks become more complex, from single-layer feed-forward, through
multi-layer feed-forward, to recurrent architectures. Our results provide
insights into why neural responses in sensory areas show signatures of
sampling-based probabilistic representations, and may inform future deep
learning algorithms and their implementation in stochastic low-precision
computing systems.

"  Existing brain network distances are often based on matrix norms. The
element-wise differences in the existing matrix norms may fail to capture
underlying topological differences. Further, matrix norms are sensitive to
outliers. A major disadvantage to element-wise distance calculations is that it
could be severely affected even by a small number of extreme edge weights. Thus
it is necessary to develop network distances that recognize topology. In this
paper, we provide a survey of bottleneck, Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distances that are adapted for brain networks, and
compare them against matrix-norm based network distances. Bottleneck and
GH-distances are often used in persistent homology. However, they were rarely
utilized to measure similarity between brain networks. KS-distance is recently
introduced to measure the similarity between networks across different
filtration values. The performance analysis was conducted using the random
network simulations with the ground truths. Using a twin imaging study, which
provides biological ground truth, we demonstrate that the KS distance has the
ability to determine heritability.

"  Realistic evolutionary fitness landscapes are notoriously difficult to
construct. A recent cutting-edge model of virus assembly consists of a
dodecahedral capsid with $12$ corresponding packaging signals in three affinity
bands. This whole genome/phenotype space consisting of $3^{12}$ genomes has
been explored via computationally expensive stochastic assembly models, giving
a fitness landscape in terms of the assembly efficiency. Using latest
machine-learning techniques by establishing a neural network, we show that the
intensive computation can be short-circuited in a matter of minutes to
astounding accuracy.

"  Sensing and reciprocating cellular systems (SARs) are important for the
operation of many biological systems. Production in interferon (IFN) SARs is
achieved through activation of the Jak-Stat pathway, and downstream
upregulation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IFN transcription, but the
role that high and low affinity IFNs play in this process remains unclear. We
present a comparative between a minimal spatio-temporal partial differential
equation (PDE) model and a novel spatio-structural-temporal (SST) model for the
consideration of receptor, binding, and metabolic aspects of SAR behaviour.
Using the SST framework, we simulate single- and multi-cluster paradigms of IFN
communication. Simulations reveal a cyclic process between the binding of IFN
to the receptor, and the consequent increase in metabolism, decreasing the
propensity for binding due to the internal feed-back mechanism. One observes
the effect of heterogeneity between cellular clusters, allowing them to
individualise and increase local production, and within clusters, where we
observe `sub popular quiescence'; a process whereby intra-cluster
subpopulations reduce their binding and metabolism such that other such
subpopulations may augment their production. Finally, we observe the ability
for low affinity IFN to communicate a long range signal, where high affinity
cannot, and the breakdown of this relationship through the introduction of cell
motility. Biological systems may utilise cell motility where environments are
unrestrictive and may use fixed system, with low affinity communication, where
a localised response is desirable.

"  The present study investigates different strategies for the treatment of a
mixture of digestate from an anaerobic digester diluted and secondary effluent
from a high rate algal pond. To this aim, the performance of two
photo-sequencing batch reactors (PSBRs) operated at high nutrients loading
rates and different solids retention times (SRTs) were compared with a
semi-continuous photobioreactor (SC). Performances were evaluated in terms of
wastewater treatment, biomass composition and biopolymers accumulation during
30 days of operation. PSBRs were operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT)
of 2 days and SRTs of 10 and 5 days (PSBR2-10 and PSBR2-5, respectively),
whereas the semi-continuous reactor was operated at a coupled HRT/SRT of 10
days (SC10-10). Results showed that PSBR2-5 achieved the highest removal rates
in terms of TN (6.7 mg L-1 d-1), TP (0.31 mg L-1 d-1), TOC (29.32 mg L-1 d-1)
and TIC (3.91 mg L-1 d-1). These results were in general 3-6 times higher than
the removal rates obtained in the SC10-10 (TN 29.74 mg L-1 d-1, TP 0.96 mg L-1
d-1, TOC 29.32 mg L-1 d-1 and TIC 3.91 mg L-1 d-1). Furthermore, both PSBRs
were able to produce biomass up to 0.09 g L-1 d-1, more than twofold the
biomass produced by the semi-continuous reactor (0.04 g L-1 d-1), and achieved
a biomass settleability of 86-92%. This study also demonstrated that the
microbial composition could be controlled by the nutrients loads, since the
three reactors were dominated by different species depending on the nutritional
conditions. Concerning biopolymers accumulation, carbohydrates concentration
achieved similar values in the three reactors (11%), whereas <0.5 % of
polyhydrohybutyrates (PHB) was produced. These low values in biopolymers
production could be related to the lack of microorganisms as cyanobacteria that
are able to accumulate carbohydrates/PHB.

"  The phylogenetic effective sample size is a parameter that has as its goal
the quantification of the amount of independent signal in a phylogenetically
correlated sample. It was studied for Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
models of trait evolution. Here, we study this composite parameter when the
trait is allowed to jump at speciation points of the phylogeny. Our numerical
study indicates that there is a non-trivial limit as the effect of jumps grows.
The limit depends on the value of the drift parameter of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process.

"  We present a novel methodology to enable control of a neuromorphic circuit in
close analogy with the physiological neuromodulation of a single neuron. The
methodology is general in that it only relies on a parallel interconnection of
elementary voltage-controlled current sources. In contrast to controlling a
nonlinear circuit through the parameter tuning of a state-space model, our
approach is purely input-output. The circuit elements are controlled and
interconnected to shape the current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) of the
circuit in prescribed timescales. In turn, shaping those I-V curves determines
the excitability properties of the circuit. We show that this methodology
enables both robust and accurate control of the circuit behavior and resembles
the biophysical mechanisms of neuromodulation. As a proof of concept, we
simulate a SPICE model composed of MOSFET transconductance amplifiers operating
in the weak inversion regime.

"  Electron Cryo-Tomography (ECT) allows 3D visualization of subcellular
structures at the submolecular resolution in close to the native state.
However, due to the high degree of structural complexity and imaging limits,
the automatic segmentation of cellular components from ECT images is very
difficult. To complement and speed up existing segmentation methods, it is
desirable to develop a generic cell component segmentation method that is 1)
not specific to particular types of cellular components, 2) able to segment
unknown cellular components, 3) fully unsupervised and does not rely on the
availability of training data. As an important step towards this goal, in this
paper, we propose a saliency detection method that computes the likelihood that
a subregion in a tomogram stands out from the background. Our method consists
of four steps: supervoxel over-segmentation, feature extraction, feature matrix
decomposition, and computation of saliency. The method produces a distribution
map that represents the regions' saliency in tomograms. Our experiments show
that our method can successfully label most salient regions detected by a human
observer, and able to filter out regions not containing cellular components.
Therefore, our method can remove the majority of the background region, and
significantly speed up the subsequent processing of segmentation and
recognition of cellular components captured by ECT.

"  We introduce a new ferromagnetic model capable of reproducing one of the most
intriguing properties of collective behaviour in starling flocks, namely the
fact that strong collective order of the system coexists with scale-free
correlations of the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom, that is the
birds' speeds. The key idea of the new theory is that the single-particle
potential needed to bound the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom
around a finite value, is marginal, that is has zero curvature. We study the
model by using mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations in three
dimensions, complemented by finite-size scaling analysis. While at the standard
critical temperature, $T_c$, the properties of the marginal model are exactly
the same as a normal ferromagnet with continuous symmetry-breaking, our results
show that a novel zero-temperature critical point emerges, so that in its
deeply ordered phase the marginal model develops divergent susceptibility and
correlation length of the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom, in
complete analogy with experimental data on natural flocks of starlings.

"  In recent years, the number of biomedical publications has steadfastly grown,
resulting in a rich source of untapped new knowledge. Most biomedical facts are
however not readily available, but buried in the form of unstructured text, and
hence their exploitation requires the time-consuming manual curation of
published articles. Here we present INtERAcT, a novel approach to extract
protein-protein interactions from a corpus of biomedical articles related to a
broad range of scientific domains in a completely unsupervised way. INtERAcT
exploits vector representation of words, computed on a corpus of domain
specific knowledge, and implements a new metric that estimates an interaction
score between two molecules in the space where the corresponding words are
embedded. We demonstrate the power of INtERAcT by reconstructing the molecular
pathways associated to 10 different cancer types using a corpus of
disease-specific articles for each cancer type. We evaluate INtERAcT using
STRING database as a benchmark, and show that our metric outperforms currently
adopted approaches for similarity computation at the task of identifying known
molecular interactions in all studied cancer types. Furthermore, our approach
does not require text annotation, manual curation or the definition of semantic
rules based on expert knowledge, and hence it can be easily and efficiently
applied to different scientific domains. Our findings suggest that INtERAcT may
increase our capability to summarize the understanding of a specific disease
using the published literature in an automated and completely unsupervised
fashion.

"  Selection of appropriate collective variables for enhancing sampling of
molecular simulations remains an unsolved problem in computational biophysics.
In particular, picking initial collective variables (CVs) is particularly
challenging in higher dimensions. Which atomic coordinates or transforms there
of from a list of thousands should one pick for enhanced sampling runs? How
does a modeler even begin to pick starting coordinates for investigation? This
remains true even in the case of simple two state systems and only increases in
difficulty for multi-state systems. In this work, we solve the initial CV
problem using a data-driven approach inspired by the filed of supervised
machine learning. In particular, we show how the decision functions in
supervised machine learning (SML) algorithms can be used as initial CVs
(SML_cv) for accelerated sampling. Using solvated alanine dipeptide and
Chignolin mini-protein as our test cases, we illustrate how the distance to the
Support Vector Machines' decision hyperplane, the output probability estimates
from Logistic Regression, the outputs from deep neural network classifiers, and
other classifiers may be used to reversibly sample slow structural transitions.
We discuss the utility of other SML algorithms that might be useful for
identifying CVs for accelerating molecular simulations.

"  One of the ultimate goals in biology is to understand the design principles
of biological systems. Such principles, if they exist, can help us better
understand complex, natural biological systems and guide the engineering of de

biological systems with proper abstraction is a promising approach. Here, we
demonstrate the application of in silico evolution combined with rule-based
modelling for exploring design principles of cellular signaling networks. This
application is based on a computational platform, called BioJazz, which allows
in silico evolution of signaling networks with unbounded complexity. We provide
a detailed introduction to BioJazz architecture and implementation and describe
how it can be used to evolve and/or design signaling networks with defined
dynamics. For the latter, we evolve signaling networks with switch-like
response dynamics and demonstrate how BioJazz can result in new biological
insights on network structures that can endow bistable response dynamics. This
example also demonstrated both the power of BioJazz in evolving and designing
signaling networks and its limitations at the current stage of development.

"  The aim of this paper is to find the approximate solution of HIV infection
model of CD4+T cells. For this reason, the homotopy analysis transform method
(HATM) is applied. The presented method is combination of traditional homotopy
analysis method (HAM) and the Laplace transformation. The convergence of
presented method is discussed by preparing a theorem which shows the
capabilities of method. The numerical results are shown for different values of
iterations. Also, the regions of convergence are demonstrated by plotting
several h-curves. Furthermore in order to show the efficiency and accuracy of
method, the residual error for different iterations are presented.

"  Despite significant recent progress in the area of Brain-Computer Interface,
there are numerous shortcomings associated with collecting
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals in real-world environments. These include,
but are not limited to, subject and session data variance, long and arduous
calibration processes and performance generalisation issues across
differentsubjects or sessions. This implies that many downstream applications,
including Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based classification
systems, can suffer from a shortage of reliable data. Generating meaningful and
realistic synthetic data can therefore be of significant value in circumventing
this problem. We explore the use of modern neural-based generative models
trained on a limited quantity of EEG data collected from different subjects to
generate supplementary synthetic EEG signal vectors subsequently utilised to
train an SSVEP classifier. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate the
efficacy of our generated data, leading to significant improvements across a
variety of evaluations, with the crucial task of cross-subject generalisation
improving by over 35% with the use of synthetic data.

"  High quality gene models are necessary to expand the molecular and genetic
tools available for a target organism, but these are available for only a
handful of model organisms that have undergone extensive curation and
experimental validation over the course of many years. The majority of gene
models present in biological databases today have been identified in draft
genome assemblies using automated annotation pipelines that are frequently
based on orthologs from distantly related model organisms. Manual curation is
time consuming and often requires substantial expertise, but is instrumental in
improving gene model structure and identification. Manual annotation may seem
to be a daunting and cost-prohibitive task for small research communities but
involving undergraduates in community genome annotation consortiums can be
mutually beneficial for both education and improved genomic resources. We
outline a workflow for efficient manual annotation driven by a team of
primarily undergraduate annotators. This model can be scaled to large teams and
includes quality control processes through incremental evaluation. Moreover, it
gives students an opportunity to increase their understanding of genome biology
and to participate in scientific research in collaboration with peers and
senior researchers at multiple institutions.

"  An increasing body of evidence suggests that the trial-to-trial variability
of spiking activity in the brain is not mere noise, but rather the reflection
of a sampling-based encoding scheme for probabilistic computing. Since the
precise statistical properties of neural activity are important in this
context, many models assume an ad-hoc source of well-behaved, explicit noise,
either on the input or on the output side of single neuron dynamics, most often
assuming an independent Poisson process in either case. However, these
assumptions are somewhat problematic: neighboring neurons tend to share
receptive fields, rendering both their input and their output correlated; at
the same time, neurons are known to behave largely deterministically, as a
function of their membrane potential and conductance. We suggest that spiking
neural networks may, in fact, have no need for noise to perform sampling-based
Bayesian inference. We study analytically the effect of auto- and
cross-correlations in functionally Bayesian spiking networks and demonstrate
how their effect translates to synaptic interaction strengths, rendering them
controllable through synaptic plasticity. This allows even small ensembles of
interconnected deterministic spiking networks to simultaneously and
co-dependently shape their output activity through learning, enabling them to
perform complex Bayesian computation without any need for noise, which we
demonstrate in silico, both in classical simulation and in neuromorphic
emulation. These results close a gap between the abstract models and the
biology of functionally Bayesian spiking networks, effectively reducing the
architectural constraints imposed on physical neural substrates required to
perform probabilistic computing, be they biological or artificial.

"  A quantized physical framework, called the five-anchor model, is developed
for a general understanding of the working mechanism of ion channels. According
to the hypotheses of this model, the following two basic physical principles
are assigned to each anchor: the polarity change induced by an electron
transition and the mutual repulsion and attraction induced by an electrostatic
force. Consequently, many unique phenomena, such as fast and slow inactivation,
the stochastic gating pattern and constant conductance of a single ion channel,
the difference between electrical and optical stimulation (optogenetics), nerve
conduction block and the generation of an action potential, become intrinsic
features of this physical model. Moreover, this model also provides a
foundation for the probability equation used to calculate the results of
electrical stimulation in our previous C-P theory.

"  Previously, a seven-cluster pattern claiming to be a universal one in
bacterial genomes has been reported. Keeping in mind the most popular theory of
chloroplast origin, we checked whether a similar pattern is observed in
chloroplast genomes. Surprisingly, eight cluster structure has been found, for
chloroplasts. The pattern observed for chloroplasts differs rather
significantly, from bacterial one, and from that latter observed for
cyanobacteria. The structure is provided by clustering of the fragments of
equal length isolated within a genome so that each fragment is converted in
triplet frequency dictionary with non-overlapping triplets with no gaps in
frame tiling. The points in 63-dimensional space were clustered due to elastic
map technique. The eight cluster found in chloroplasts comprises the fragments
of a genome bearing tRNA genes and exhibiting excessively high
$\mathsf{GC}$-content, in comparison to the entire genome.

"  PEBPs (PhosphatidylEthanolamine Binding Proteins) form a protein family
widely present in the living world since they are encountered in
microorganisms, plants and animals. In all organisms PEBPs appear to regulate
important mechanisms that govern cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation and
motility. In humans, three PEBPs have been identified, namely PEBP1, PEBP2 and
PEBP4. PEBP1 and PEBP4 are the most studied as they are implicated in the
development of various cancers. PEBP2 is specific of testes in mammals and was
essentially studied in rats and mice where it is very abundant. A lot of
information has been gained on PEBP1 also named RKIP (Raf Kinase Inhibitory
protein) due to its role as a metastasis suppressor in cancer. PEBP1 was also
demonstrated to be implicated in Alzheimers disease, diabetes and
nephropathies. Furthermore, PEBP1 was described to be involved in many cellular
processes, among them are signal transduction, inflammation, cell cycle,
proliferation, adhesion, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, circadian
rhythm and mitotic spindle checkpoint. On the molecular level, PEBP1 was shown
to regulate several signaling pathways such as Raf/MEK/ERK, NFkB,
PI3K/Akt/mTOR, p38, Notch and Wnt. PEBP1 acts by inhibiting most of the kinases
of these signaling cascades. Moreover, PEBP1 is able to bind to a variety of
small ligands such as ATP, phospholipids, nucleotides, flavonoids or drugs.
Considering PEBP1 is a small cytoplasmic protein (21kDa), its involvement in so
many diseases and cellular mechanisms is amazing. The aim of this review is to
highlight the molecular systems that are common to all these cellular
mechanisms in order to decipher the specific role of PEBP1. Recent discoveries
enable us to propose that PEBP1 is a modulator of molecular interactions that
control signal transduction during membrane and cytoskeleton reorganization.
"
"  Inductive inference is the process of extracting general rules from specific
observations. This problem also arises in the analysis of biological networks,
such as genetic regulatory networks, where the interactions are complex and the
observations are incomplete. A typical task in these problems is to extract
general interaction rules as combinations of Boolean covariates, that explain a
measured response variable. The inductive inference process can be considered
as an incompletely specified Boolean function synthesis problem. This
incompleteness of the problem will also generate spurious inferences, which are
a serious threat to valid inductive inference rules. Using random Boolean data
as a null model, here we attempt to measure the competition between valid and
spurious inductive inference rules from a given data set. We formulate two
greedy search algorithms, which synthesize a given Boolean response variable in
a sparse disjunct normal form, and respectively a sparse generalized algebraic
normal form of the variables from the observation data, and we evaluate
numerically their performance.
"
"  Schizophrenia, a mental disorder that is characterized by abnormal social
behavior and failure to distinguish one's own thoughts and ideas from reality,
has been associated with structural abnormalities in the architecture of
functional brain networks. Using various methods from network analysis, we
examine the effect of two classical therapeutic antipsychotics --- Aripiprazole
and Sulpiride --- on the structure of functional brain networks of healthy
controls and patients who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. We compare
the community structures of functional brain networks of different individuals
using mesoscopic response functions, which measure how community structure
changes across different scales of a network. We are able to do a reasonably
good job of distinguishing patients from controls, and we are most successful
at this task on people who have been treated with Aripiprazole. We demonstrate
that this increased separation between patients and controls is related only to
a change in the control group, as the functional brain networks of the patient
group appear to be predominantly unaffected by this drug. This suggests that
Aripiprazole has a significant and measurable effect on community structure in
healthy individuals but not in individuals who are diagnosed with
schizophrenia. In contrast, we find for individuals are given the drug
Sulpiride that it is more difficult to separate the networks of patients from
those of controls. Overall, we observe differences in the effects of the drugs
(and a placebo) on community structure in patients and controls and also that
this effect differs across groups. We thereby demonstrate that different types
of antipsychotic drugs selectively affect mesoscale structures of brain
networks, providing support that mesoscale structures such as communities are
meaningful functional units in the brain.
"
"  Dominance by annual plants has traditionally been considered a brief early
stage of ecological succession preceding inevitable dominance by competitive
perennials. A more recent, alternative view suggests that interactions between
annuals and perennials can result in priority effects, causing annual dominance
to persist if they are initially more common. Such priority effects would
complicate restoration of native perennial grasslands that have been invaded by
exotic annuals. However, the conditions under which these priority effects
occur remain unknown. Using a simple simulation model, we show that long-term
(500 years) priority effects are possible as long as the plants have low
fecundity and show an establishment-longevity tradeoff, with annuals having
competitive advantage over perennial seedlings. We also show that short-term
(up to 50 years) priority effects arise solely due to low fitness difference in
cases where perennials dominate in the long term. These results provide a
theoretical basis for predicting when restoration of annual-invaded grasslands
requires active removal of annuals and timely reintroduction of perennials.
"
"  In systems and synthetic biology, much research has focused on the behavior
and design of single pathways, while, more recently, experimental efforts have
focused on how cross-talk (coupling two or more pathways) or inhibiting
molecular function (isolating one part of the pathway) affects systems-level
behavior. However, the theory for tackling these larger systems in general has
lagged behind. Here, we analyze how joining networks (e.g., cross-talk) or
decomposing networks (e.g., inhibition or knock-outs) affects three properties
that reaction networks may possess---identifiability (recoverability of
parameter values from data), steady-state invariants (relationships among
species concentrations at steady state, used in model selection), and
multistationarity (capacity for multiple steady states, which correspond to
multiple cell decisions). Specifically, we prove results that clarify, for a
network obtained by joining two smaller networks, how properties of the smaller
networks can be inferred from or can imply similar properties of the original
network. Our proofs use techniques from computational algebraic geometry,
including elimination theory and differential algebra.
"
"  Almost all EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) need some labeled
subject-specific data to calibrate a new subject, as neural responses are
different across subjects to even the same stimulus. So, a major challenge in
developing high-performance and user-friendly BCIs is to cope with such
individual differences so that the calibration can be reduced or even
completely eliminated. This paper focuses on the latter. More specifically, we
consider an offline application scenario, in which we have unlabeled EEG trials
from a new subject, and would like to accurately label them by leveraging
auxiliary labeled EEG trials from other subjects in the same task. To
accommodate the individual differences, we propose a novel unsupervised
approach to align the EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space
to make them more consistent. It has three desirable properties: 1) the aligned
trial lie in the Euclidean space, which can be used by any Euclidean space
signal processing and machine learning approach; 2) it can be computed very
efficiently; and, 3) it does not need any labeled trials from the new subject.
Experiments on motor imagery and event-related potentials demonstrated the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
"
"  We studied acetylhistidine (AcH), bare or microsolvated with a zinc cation by
simulations in isolation. First, a global search for minima of the potential
energy surface combining both, empirical and first-principles methods, is
performed individually for either one of five possible protonation states.
Comparing the most stable structures between tautomeric forms of negatively
charged AcH shows a clear preference for conformers with the neutral imidazole
ring protonated at the N-epsilon-2 atom. When adding a zinc cation to the
system, the situation is reversed and N-delta-1-protonated structures are
energetically more favorable. Obtained minima structures then served as basis
for a benchmark study to examine the goodness of commonly applied levels of
theory, i.e. force fields, semi-empirical methods, density-functional
approximations (DFA), and wavefunction-based methods with respect to high-level
coupled-cluster calculations, i.e. the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method. All tested force
fields and semi-empirical methods show a poor performance in reproducing the
energy hierarchies of conformers, in particular of systems involving the zinc
cation. Meta-GGA, hybrid, double hybrid DFAs, and the MP2 method are able to
describe the energetics of the reference method within chemical accuracy, i.e.
with a mean absolute error of less than 1kcal/mol. Best performance is found
for the double hybrid DFA B3LYP+XYG3 with a mean absolute error of 0.7 kcal/mol
and a maximum error of 1.8 kcal/mol. While MP2 performs similarly as
B3LYP+XYG3, computational costs, i.e. timings, are increased by a factor of 4
in comparison due to the large basis sets required for accurate results.
"
"  The present paper proposes a novel method of quantification of the variation
in biofilm architecture, in correlation with the alteration of growth
conditions that include, variations of substrate and conditioning layer. The
polymeric biomaterial serving as substrates are widely used in implants and
indwelling medical devices, while the plasma proteins serve as the conditioning
layer. The present method uses descriptive statistics of FESEM images of
biofilms obtained during a variety of growth conditions. We aim to explore here
the texture and fractal analysis techniques, to identify the most
discriminatory features which are capable of predicting the difference in
biofilm growth conditions. We initially extract some statistical features of
biofilm images on bare polymer surfaces, followed by those on the same
substrates adsorbed with two different types of plasma proteins, viz. Bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and Fibronectin (FN), for two different adsorption times.
The present analysis has the potential to act as a futuristic technology for
developing a computerized monitoring system in hospitals with automated image
analysis and feature extraction, which may be used to predict the growth
profile of an emerging biofilm on surgical implants or similar medical
applications.
"
"  When our eyes are presented with the same image, the brain processes it to
view it as a single coherent one. The lateral shift in the position of our
eyes, causes the two images to possess certain differences, which our brain
exploits for the purpose of depth perception and to gauge the size of objects
at different distances, a process commonly known as stereopsis. However, when
presented with two different visual stimuli, the visual awareness alternates.
This phenomenon of binocular rivalry is a result of competition between the
corresponding neuronal populations of the two eyes. The article presents a
comparative study of various dynamical models proposed to capture this process.
It goes on to study the effect of a certain parameter on the rate of perceptual
alternations and proceeds to disprove the initial propositions laid down to
characterise this phenomenon. It concludes with a discussion on the possible
future work that can be conducted to obtain a better picture of the neuronal
functioning behind this rivalry.
"
"  We consider the task of estimating a high-dimensional directed acyclic graph,
given observations from a linear structural equation model with arbitrary noise
distribution. By exploiting properties of common random graphs, we develop a
new algorithm that requires conditioning only on small sets of variables. The
proposed algorithm, which is essentially a modified version of the
PC-Algorithm, offers significant gains in both computational complexity and
estimation accuracy. In particular, it results in more efficient and accurate
estimation in large networks containing hub nodes, which are common in
biological systems. We prove the consistency of the proposed algorithm, and
show that it also requires a less stringent faithfulness assumption than the
PC-Algorithm. Simulations in low and high-dimensional settings are used to
illustrate these findings. An application to gene expression data suggests that
the proposed algorithm can identify a greater number of clinically relevant
genes than current methods.

"  Characterizing a patient's progression through stages of sepsis is critical
for enabling risk stratification and adaptive, personalized treatment. However,
commonly used sepsis diagnostic criteria fail to account for significant
underlying heterogeneity, both between patients as well as over time in a
single patient. We introduce a hidden Markov model of sepsis progression that
explicitly accounts for patient heterogeneity. Benchmarked against two sepsis
diagnostic criteria, the model provides a useful tool to uncover a patient's
latent sepsis trajectory and to identify high-risk patients in whom more
aggressive therapy may be indicated.
"
"  Experimentalists have observed phenotypic variability in isogenic bacteria
populations. We explore the hypothesis that in fluctuating environments this
variability is tuned to maximize a bacterium's expected log growth rate,
potentially aided by epigenetic markers that store information about past
environments. We show that, in a complex, memoryful environment, the maximal
expected log growth rate is linear in the instantaneous predictive
information---the mutual information between a bacterium's epigenetic markers
and future environmental states. Hence, under resource constraints, optimal
epigenetic markers are causal states---the minimal sufficient statistics for
prediction. This is the minimal amount of information about the past needed to
predict the future as well as possible. We suggest new theoretical
investigations into and new experiments on bacteria phenotypic bet-hedging in
fluctuating complex environments.
"
"  The collective behavior of active semiflexible filaments is studied with a
model of tangentially driven self-propelled worm-like chains. The combination
of excluded-volume interactions and self-propulsion leads to several distinct
dynamic phases as a function of bending rigidity, activity, and aspect ratio of
individual filaments. We consider first the case of intermediate filament
density. For high-aspect-ratio filaments, we identify a transition with
increasing propulsion from a state of free-swimming filaments to a state of
spiraled filaments with nearly frozen translational motion. For lower aspect
ratios, this gas-of-spirals phase is suppressed with growing density due to
filament collisions; instead, filaments form clusters similar to self-propelled
rods, as activity increases. Finite bending rigidity strongly effects the
dynamics and phase behavior. Flexible filaments form small and transient
clusters, while stiffer filaments organize into giant clusters, similarly as
self-propelled rods, but with a reentrant phase behavior from giant to smaller
clusters as activity becomes large enough to bend the filaments. For high
filament densities, we identify a nearly frozen jamming state at low
activities, a nematic laning state at intermediate activities, and an
active-turbulence state at high activities. The latter state is characterized
by a power-law decay of the energy spectrum as a function of wave number. The
resulting phase diagrams encapsulate tunable non-equilibrium steady states that
can be used in the organization of living matter.
"
"  The fitness of a species determines its abundance and survival in an
ecosystem. At the same time, species take up resources for growth, so their
abundance affects the availability of resources in an ecosystem. We show here
that such species-resource coupling can be used to assign a quantitative metric
for fitness to each species. This fitness metric also allows for the modeling
of drift in species composition, and hence ecosystem evolution through
speciation and adaptation. Our results provide a foundation for an entirely
computational exploration of evolutionary ecosystem dynamics on any length or
time scale. For example, we can evolve ecosystem dynamics even by initiating
dynamics out of a single primordial ancestor and show that there exists a well
defined ecosystem-averaged fitness dynamics that is resilient against resource
shocks.
"
"  Discerning how a mutation affects the stability of a protein is central to
the study of a wide range of diseases. Machine learning and statistical
analysis techniques can inform how to allocate limited resources to the
considerable time and cost associated with wet lab mutagenesis experiments. In
this work we explore the effectiveness of using a neural network classifier to
predict the change in the stability of a protein due to a mutation. Assessing
the accuracy of our approach is dependent on the use of experimental data about
the effects of mutations performed in vitro. Because the experimental data is
prone to discrepancies when similar experiments have been performed by multiple
laboratories, the use of the data near the juncture of stabilizing and
destabilizing mutations is questionable. We address this later problem via a
systematic approach in which we explore the use of a three-way classification
scheme with stabilizing, destabilizing, and inconclusive labels. For a
systematic search of potential classification cutoff values our classifier
achieved 68 percent accuracy on ternary classification for cutoff values of
-0.6 and 0.7 with a low rate of classifying stabilizing as destabilizing and
vice versa.
"
"  Neural field theory is used to quantitatively analyze the two-dimensional
spatiotemporal correlation properties of gamma-band (30 -- 70 Hz) oscillations
evoked by stimuli arriving at the primary visual cortex (V1), and modulated by
patchy connectivities that depend on orientation preference (OP). Correlation
functions are derived analytically under different stimulus and measurement
conditions. The predictions reproduce a range of published experimental
results, including the existence of two-point oscillatory temporal
cross-correlations with zero time-lag between neurons with similar OP, the
influence of spatial separation of neurons on the strength of the correlations,
and the effects of differing stimulus orientations.
"
"  The theory of receptor-ligand binding equilibria has long been
well-established in biochemistry, and was primarily constructed to describe
dilute aqueous solutions. Accordingly, few computational approaches have been
developed for making quantitative predictions of binding probabilities in
environments other than dilute isotropic solution. Existing techniques, ranging
from simple automated docking procedures to sophisticated thermodynamics-based
methods, have been developed with soluble proteins in mind. Biologically and
pharmacologically relevant protein-ligand interactions often occur in complex
environments, including lamellar phases like membranes and crowded, non-dilute
solutions. Here we revisit the theoretical bases of ligand binding equilibria,
avoiding overly specific assumptions that are nearly always made when
describing receptor-ligand binding. Building on this formalism, we extend the
asymptotically exact Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation technique to
quantifying occupancies of sites on proteins in a complex bulk, including
phase-separated, anisotropic, or non-dilute solutions, using a
thermodynamically consistent and easily generalized approach that resolves
several ambiguities of current frameworks. To incorporate the complex bulk
without overcomplicating the overall thermodynamic cycle, we simplify the
common approach for ligand restraints by using a single
distance-from-bound-configuration (DBC) ligand restraint during AFEP decoupling
from protein. DBC restraints should be generalizable to binding modes of most
small molecules, even those with strong orientational dependence. We apply this
approach to compute the likelihood that membrane cholesterol binds to known
crystallographic sites on 3 GPCRs at a range of concentrations. Non-ideality of
cholesterol in a binary cholesterol:POPC bilayer is characterized and
consistently incorporated into the interpretation.
"
"  It is inconceivable how chaotic the world would look to humans, faced with
innumerable decisions a day to be made under uncertainty, had they been lacking
the capacity to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant---a capacity which
computationally amounts to handling probabilistic independence relations. The
highly parallel and distributed computational machinery of the brain suggests
that a satisfying process-level account of human independence judgment should
also mimic these features. In this work, we present the first rational,
distributed, message-passing, process-level account of independence judgment,
called $\mathcal{D}^\ast$. Interestingly, $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ shows a curious,
but normatively-justified tendency for quick detection of dependencies,
whenever they hold. Furthermore, $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ outperforms all the
previously proposed algorithms in the AI literature in terms of worst-case
running time, and a salient aspect of it is supported by recent work in
neuroscience investigating possible implementations of Bayes nets at the neural
level. $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ nicely exemplifies how the pursuit of cognitive
plausibility can lead to the discovery of state-of-the-art algorithms with
appealing properties, and its simplicity makes $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ potentially a
good candidate for pedagogical purposes.
"
"  We study that the breakdown of epidemic depends on some parameters, that is
expressed in epidemic reproduction ratio number. It is noted that when $R_0 $
exceeds 1, the stochastic model have two different results. But, eventually the
extinction will be reached even though the major epidemic occurs. The question
is how long this process will reach extinction. In this paper, we will focus on
the Markovian process of SIS model when major epidemic occurs. Using the
approximation of quasi--stationary distribution, the expected mean time of
extinction only occurs when the process is one step away from being extinct.
Combining the theorm from Ethier and Kurtz, we use CLT to find the
approximation of this quasi distribution and successfully determine the
asymptotic mean time to extinction of SIS model without demography.
"
"  Hair cells of the auditory and vestibular systems are capable of detecting
sounds that induce sub-nanometer vibrations of the hair bundle, below the
stochastic noise levels of the surrounding fluid. Hair cells of certain species
are also known to oscillate without external stimulation, indicating the
presence of an underlying active mechanism. We previously demonstrated that
these spontaneous oscillations exhibit chaotic dynamics. By varying the Calcium
concentration and the viscosity of the Endolymph solution, we are able to
modulate the degree of chaos in the hair cell dynamics. We find that the hair
cell is most sensitive to a stimulus of small amplitude when it is poised in
the weakly chaotic regime. Further, we show that the response time to a force
step decreases with increasing levels of chaos. These results agree well with
our numerical simulations of a chaotic Hopf oscillator and suggest that chaos
may be responsible for the extreme sensitivity and temporal resolution of hair
cells.
"
"  Contact-assisted protein folding has made very good progress, but two
challenges remain. One is accurate contact prediction for proteins lack of many
sequence homologs and the other is that time-consuming folding simulation is
often needed to predict good 3D models from predicted contacts. We show that
protein distance matrix can be predicted well by deep learning and then
directly used to construct 3D models without folding simulation at all. Using
distance geometry to construct 3D models from our predicted distance matrices,
we successfully folded 21 of the 37 CASP12 hard targets with a median family
size of 58 effective sequence homologs within 4 hours on a Linux computer of 20
CPUs. In contrast, contacts predicted by direct coupling analysis (DCA) cannot
fold any of them in the absence of folding simulation and the best CASP12 group
folded 11 of them by integrating predicted contacts into complex,
fragment-based folding simulation. The rigorous experimental validation on 15
CASP13 targets show that among the 3 hardest targets of new fold our
distance-based folding servers successfully folded 2 large ones with <150
sequence homologs while the other servers failed on all three, and that our ab
initio folding server also predicted the best, high-quality 3D model for a
large homology modeling target. Further experimental validation in CAMEO shows
that our ab initio folding server predicted correct fold for a membrane protein
of new fold with 200 residues and 229 sequence homologs while all the other
servers failed. These results imply that deep learning offers an efficient and
accurate solution for ab initio folding on a personal computer.
"
"  Chemotaxis is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon in which cells detect a
spatial gradient of chemoattractant, and then move towards the source. Here we
present a position-dependent advection-diffusion model that quantitatively
describes the statistical features of the chemotactic motion of the social
amoeba {\it Dictyostelium discoideum} in a linear gradient of cAMP (cyclic
adenosine monophosphate). We fit the model to experimental trajectories that
are recorded in a microfluidic setup with stationary cAMP gradients and extract
the diffusion and drift coefficients in the gradient direction. Our analysis
shows that for the majority of gradients, both coefficients decrease in time
and become negative as the cells crawl up the gradient. The extracted model
parameters also show that besides the expected drift in the direction of
chemoattractant gradient, we observe a nonlinear dependency of the
corresponding variance in time, which can be explained by the model.
Furthermore, the results of the model show that the non-linear term in the mean
squared displacement of the cell trajectories can dominate the linear term on
large time scales.
"
"  The distributions of species lifetimes and species in space are related,
since species with good local survival chances have more time to colonize new
habitats and species inhabiting large areas have higher chances to survive
local disturbances. Yet, both distributions have been discussed in mostly
separate communities. Here, we study both patterns simultaneously using a
spatially explicit, evolutionary community assembly approach. We present and
investigate a metacommunity model, consisting of a grid of patches, where each
patch contains a local food web. Species survival depends on predation and
competition interactions, which in turn depend on species body masses as the
key traits. The system evolves due to the migration of species to neighboring
patches, the addition of new species as modifications of existing species, and
local extinction events. The structure of each local food web thus emerges in a
self-organized manner as the highly non-trivial outcome of the relative time
scales of these processes. Our model generates a large variety of complex,
multi-trophic networks and therefore serves as a powerful tool to investigate
ecosystems on long temporal and large spatial scales. We find that the observed
lifetime distributions and species-area relations resemble power laws over
appropriately chosen parameter ranges and thus agree qualitatively with
empirical findings. Moreover, we observe strong finite-size effects, and a
dependence of the relationships on the trophic level of the species. By
comparing our results to simple neutral models found in the literature, we
identify the features that are responsible for the values of the exponents.
"
"  Humans are increasingly stressing ecosystems via habitat destruction, climate
change and global population movements leading to the widespread loss of
biodiversity and the disruption of key ecological services. Ecosystems
characterized primarily by mutualistic relationships between species such as
plant-pollinator interactions may be particularly vulnerable to such
perturbations because the loss of biodiversity can cause extinction cascades
that can compromise the entire network. Here, we develop a general restoration
strategy based on network-science for degraded ecosystems. Specifically, we
show that network topology can be used to identify the optimal sequence of
species reintroductions needed to maximize biodiversity gains following partial
and full ecosystem collapse. This restoration strategy generalizes across
topologically-disparate and geographically-distributed ecosystems.
Additionally, we find that although higher connectance and diversity promote
persistence in pristine ecosystems, these attributes reduce the effectiveness
of restoration efforts in degraded networks. Hence, focusing on restoring the
factors that promote persistence in pristine ecosystems may yield suboptimal
recovery strategies for degraded ecosystems. Overall, our results have
important insights for designing effective ecosystem restoration strategies to
preserve biodiversity and ensure the delivery of critical natural services that
fuel economic development, food security and human health around the globe

"  We examine the problem of transforming matching collections of data points
into optimal correspondence. The classic RMSD (root-mean-square deviation)
method calculates a 3D rotation that minimizes the RMSD of a set of test data
points relative to a reference set of corresponding points. Similar literature
in aeronautics, photogrammetry, and proteomics employs numerical methods to
find the maximal eigenvalue of a particular $4\!\times\! 4$ quaternion-based
matrix, thus specifying the quaternion eigenvector corresponding to the optimal
3D rotation. Here we generalize this basic problem, sometimes referred to as
the ""Procrustes Problem,"" and present algebraic solutions that exhibit
properties that are inaccessible to traditional numerical methods. We begin
with the 4D data problem, a problem one dimension higher than the conventional
3D problem, but one that is also solvable by quaternion methods, we then study
the 3D and 2D data problems as special cases. In addition, we consider data
that are themselves quaternions isomorphic to orthonormal triads describing 3
coordinate frames (amino acids in proteins possess such frames). Adopting a
reasonable approximation to the exact quaternion-data minimization problem, we
find a novel closed form ""quaternion RMSD"" (QRMSD) solution for the optimal
rotation from a quaternion data set to a reference set. We observe that
composites of the RMSD and QRMSD measures, combined with problem-dependent
parameters including scaling factors to make their incommensurate dimensions
compatible, could be suitable for certain matching tasks.

"  The development of spiking neural network simulation software is a critical
component enabling the modeling of neural systems and the development of
biologically inspired algorithms. Existing software frameworks support a wide
range of neural functionality, software abstraction levels, and hardware
devices, yet are typically not suitable for rapid prototyping or application to
problems in the domain of machine learning. In this paper, we describe a new
Python package for the simulation of spiking neural networks, specifically
geared towards machine learning and reinforcement learning. Our software,
called BindsNET, enables rapid building and simulation of spiking networks and
features user-friendly, concise syntax. BindsNET is built on top of the PyTorch
deep neural networks library, enabling fast CPU and GPU computation for large
spiking networks. The BindsNET framework can be adjusted to meet the needs of
other existing computing and hardware environments, e.g., TensorFlow. We also
provide an interface into the OpenAI gym library, allowing for training and
evaluation of spiking networks on reinforcement learning problems. We argue
that this package facilitates the use of spiking networks for large-scale
machine learning experimentation, and show some simple examples of how we
envision BindsNET can be used in practice. BindsNET code is available at

human neuroimaging dataset on the Open Science Grid with opportunistic use of

"  We theoretically investigate the mechanical stability of three-dimensional
(3D) foam geometry in a cell sheet and apply its understandings to epithelial
integrity and cell delamination. Analytical calculations revealed that the
monolayer integrity of cell sheet is lost to delamination by a spontaneous
symmetry breaking, inherently depending on the 3D foam geometry of cells; i.e.,
the instability spontaneously appears when the cell density in the sheet plane
increases and/or when the number of neighboring cells decreases, as observed in
vivo. The instability is also facilitated by the delaminated cell-specific
force generation upon lateral surfaces, which are driven by cell-intrinsic
genetic programs during cell invasion and apoptosis in physiology. In
principle, this instability emerges from the force balance on the lateral
boundaries among cells. Additionally, taking into account the cell-intrinsic
force generation on apical and basal sides, which are also broadly observed in
morphogenesis, homeostasis, and carcinogenesis, we found apically/basally
directed cell delaminations and pseudostratified structures, which could
universally explain mechanical regulations of epithelial geometries in both
physiology and pathophysiology.

"  Reaction networks are mainly used to model the time-evolution of molecules of
interacting chemical species. Stochastic models are typically used when the
counts of the molecules are low, whereas deterministic models are used when the
counts are in high abundance. In 2011, the notion of `tiers' was introduced to
study the long time behavior of deterministically modeled reaction networks
that are weakly reversible and have a single linkage class. This `tier' based
argument was analytical in nature. Later, in 2014, the notion of a strongly
endotactic network was introduced in order to generalize the previous results
from weakly reversible networks with a single linkage class to this wider
family of networks. The point of view of this later work was more geometric and
algebraic in nature. The notion of strongly endotactic networks was later used
in 2018 to prove a large deviation principle for a class of stochastically
modeled reaction networks.
We provide an analytical characterization of strongly endotactic networks in
terms of tier structures. By doing so, we shed light on the connection between
the two points of view, and also make available a new proof technique for the
study of strongly endotactic networks. We show the power of this new technique
in two distinct ways. First, we demonstrate how the main previous results
related to strongly endotactic networks, both for the deterministic and
stochastic modeling choices, can be quickly obtained from our characterization.
Second, we demonstrate how new results can be obtained by proving that a
sub-class of strongly endotactic networks, when modeled stochastically, is
positive recurrent. Finally, and similarly to recent independent work by Agazzi
and Mattingly, we provide an example which closes a conjecture in the negative
by showing that stochastically modeled strongly endotactic networks can be
transient (and even explosive).

"  In psychological measurements, two levels should be distinguished: the
'individual level', relative to the different participants in a given cognitive
situation, and the 'collective level', relative to the overall statistics of
their outcomes, which we propose to associate with a notion of 'collective
participant'. When the distinction between these two levels is properly
formalized, it reveals why the modeling of the collective participant generally
requires beyond-quantum - non-Bornian - probabilistic models, when sequential
measurements at the individual level are considered, and this though a pure
quantum description remains valid for single measurement situations.
"
"  Animal groups exhibit emergent properties that are a consequence of local
interactions. Linking individual-level behaviour to coarse-grained descriptions
of animal groups has been a question of fundamental interest. Here, we present
two complementary approaches to deriving coarse-grained descriptions of
collective behaviour at so-called mesoscopic scales, which account for the
stochasticity arising from the finite sizes of animal groups. We construct
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for a coarse-grained variable that
describes the order/consensus within a group. The first method of construction
is based on van Kampen's system-size expansion of transition rates. The second
method employs Gillespie's chemical Langevin equations. We apply these two
methods to two microscopic models from the literature, in which organisms
stochastically interact and choose between two directions/choices of foraging.
These `binary-choice' models differ only in the types of interactions between
individuals, with one assuming simple pair-wise interactions, and the other
incorporating higher-order effects. In both cases, the derived mesoscopic SDEs
have multiplicative, or state-dependent, noise. However, the different models
demonstrate the contrasting effects of noise: increasing order in the pair-wise
interaction model, whilst reducing order in the higher-order interaction model.
Although both methods yield identical SDEs for such binary-choice, or
one-dimensional, systems, the relative tractability of the chemical Langevin
approach is beneficial in generalizations to higher-dimensions. In summary,
this book chapter provides a pedagogical review of two complementary methods to
construct mesoscopic descriptions from microscopic rules and demonstrates how
resultant multiplicative noise can have counter-intuitive effects on shaping
collective behaviour.

"  Our daily perceptual experience is driven by different neural mechanisms that
yield multisensory interaction as the interplay between exogenous stimuli and
endogenous expectations. While the interaction of multisensory cues according
to their spatiotemporal properties and the formation of multisensory
feature-based representations have been widely studied, the interaction of
spatial-associative neural representations has received considerably less
attention. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that models
the interaction of spatial-associative representations to perform causal
inference of audiovisual stimuli. We investigate the spatial alignment of
exogenous audiovisual stimuli modulated by associative congruence. In the
spatial layer, topographically arranged networks account for the interaction of
audiovisual input in terms of population codes. In the associative layer,
congruent audiovisual representations are obtained via the experience-driven
development of feature-based associations. Levels of congruency are obtained as
a by-product of the neurodynamics of self-organizing networks, where the amount
of neural activation triggered by the input can be expressed via a nonlinear
distance function. Our novel proposal is that activity-driven levels of
congruency can be used as top-down modulatory projections to spatially
distributed representations of sensory input, e.g. semantically related
audiovisual pairs will yield a higher level of integration than unrelated
pairs. Furthermore, levels of neural response in unimodal layers may be seen as
sensory reliability for the dynamic weighting of crossmodal cues. We describe a
series of planned experiments to validate our model in the tasks of
multisensory interaction on the basis of semantic congruence and unimodal cue
reliability.

"  Motivation: The scratch assay is a standard experimental protocol used to
characterize cell migration. It can be used to identify genes that regulate
migration and evaluate the efficacy of potential drugs that inhibit cancer
invasion. In these experiments, a scratch is made on a cell monolayer and
recolonisation of the scratched region is imaged to quantify cell migration
rates. A drawback of this methodology is the lack of its reproducibility
resulting in irregular cell-free areas with crooked leading edges. Existing
quantification methods deal poorly with such resulting irregularities present
in the data. Results: We introduce a new quantification method that can analyse
low quality experimental data. By considering in-silico and in-vitro data, we
show that the method provides a more accurate statistical classification of the
migration rates than two established quantification methods. The application of
this method will enable the quantification of migration rates of scratch assay
data previously unsuitable for analysis. Availability and Implementation: The
source code and the implementation of the algorithm as a GUI along with an
example dataset and user instructions, are available in

"  A Y-linked two-sex branching process with mutations and blind choice of males
is a suitable model for analyzing the evolution of the number of carriers of an
allele and its mutations of a Y-linked gene. Considering a two-sex monogamous
population, in this model each female chooses her partner from among the male
population without caring about his type (i.e., the allele he carries). In this
work, we deal with the problem of estimating the main parameters of such model
developing the Bayesian inference in a parametric framework. Firstly, we
consider, as sample scheme, the observation of the total number of females and
males up to some generation as well as the number of males of each genotype at
last generation. Later, we introduce the information of the mutated males only
in the last generation obtaining in this way a second sample scheme. For both
samples, we apply the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methodology to
approximate the posterior distributions of the main parameters of this model.
The accuracy of the procedure based on these samples is illustrated and
discussed by way of simulated examples.

"  Cell shape is an important biomarker. Previously extensive studies have
established the relation between cell shape and cell function. However, the
morphodynamics, namely the temporal fluctuation of cell shape is much less
understood. We study the morphodynamics of MDA-MB-231 cells in type I collagen
extracellular matrix (ECM). We find ECM mechanics, as tuned by collagen
concentration, controls the morphodynamics but not the static cell morphology.
By employing machine learning techniques, we classify cell shape into five
different morphological phenotypes corresponding to different migration modes.
As a result, cell morphodynamics is mapped into temporal evolution of
morphological phenotypes. We systematically characterize the phenotype dynamics
including occurrence probability, dwell time, transition flux, and also obtain
the invasion characteristics of each phenotype. Using a tumor organoid model,
we show that the distinct invasion potentials of each phenotype modulate the
phenotype homeostasis. Overall invasion of a tumor organoid is facilitated by
individual cells searching for and committing to phenotypes of higher invasive
potential. In conclusion, we show that 3D migrating cancer cells exhibit rich
morphodynamics that is regulated by ECM mechanics and is closely related with
cell motility. Our results pave the way to systematic characterization and
functional understanding of cell morphodynamics.

"  The Machine Recognition of Crystallization Outcomes (MARCO) initiative has
assembled roughly half a million annotated images of macromolecular
crystallization experiments from various sources and setups. Here,
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are trained and tested on
different parts of this data set. We find that more than 94% of the test images
can be correctly labeled, irrespective of their experimental origin. Because
crystal recognition is key to high-density screening and the systematic
analysis of crystallization experiments, this approach opens the door to both
industrial and fundamental research applications.

"  The emerging era of personalized medicine relies on medical decisions,
practices, and products being tailored to the individual patient. Point-of-care
systems, at the heart of this model, play two important roles. First, they are
required for identifying subjects for optimal therapies based on their genetic
make-up and epigenetic profile. Second, they will be used for assessing the
progression of such therapies. Central to this vision is designing systems
that, with minimal user-intervention, can transduce complex signals from
biosystems in complement with clinical information to inform medical decision
within point-of-care settings. To reach our ultimate goal of developing
point-of-care systems and realizing personalized medicine, we are taking a
multistep systems-level approach towards understanding cellular processes and
biomolecular profiles, to quantify disease states and external interventions.

"  The apelinergic system is an important player in the regulation of both
vascular tone and cardiovascular function, making this physiological system an
attractive target for drug development for hypertension, heart failure and
ischemic heart disease. Indeed, apelin exerts a positive inotropic effect in
humans whilst reducing peripheral vascular resistance. In this study, we
investigated the signaling pathways through which apelin exerts its hypotensive
action. We synthesized a series of apelin-13 analogs whereby the C-terminal
Phe13 residue was replaced by natural or unnatural amino acids. In HEK293 cells
expressing APJ, we evaluated the relative efficacy of these compounds to
activate G{\alpha}i1 and G{\alpha}oA G-proteins, recruit \b{eta}-arrestins 1
and 2 (\b{eta}arrs), and inhibit cAMP production. Calculating the transduction
ratio for each pathway allowed us to identify several analogs with distinct
signaling profiles. Furthermore, we found that these analogs delivered i.v. to
Sprague-Dawley rats exerted a wide range of hypotensive responses. Indeed, two
compounds lost their ability to lower blood pressure, while other analogs
significantly reduced blood pressure as apelin-13. Interestingly, analogs that
did not lower blood pressure were less effective at recruiting \b{eta}arrs.
Finally, using Spearman correlations, we established that the hypotensive
response was significantly correlated with \b{eta}arr recruitment but not with
G protein- dependent signaling. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that
the \b{eta}arr recruitment potency is involved in the hypotensive efficacy of
activated APJ.

"  Organisms use hair-like cilia that beat in a metachronal fashion to actively
transport fluid and suspended particles. Metachronal motion emerges due to a
phase difference between beating cycles of neighboring cilia and appears as
traveling waves propagating along ciliary carpet. In this work, we demonstrate
biomimetic artificial cilia capable of metachronal motion. The cilia are
micromachined magnetic thin filaments attached at one end to a substrate and
actuated by a uniform rotating magnetic field. We show that the difference in
magnetic cilium length controls the phase of the beating motion. We use this
property to induce metachronal waves within a ciliary array and explore the
effect of operation parameters on the wave motion. The metachronal motion in
our artificial system is shown to depend on the magnetic and elastic properties
of the filaments, unlike natural cilia, where metachronal motion arises due to
fluid coupling. Our approach enables an easy integration of metachronal
magnetic cilia in lab-on-a-chip devices for enhanced fluid and particle
manipulations.

"  The advent of miniaturized biologging devices has provided ecologists with
unparalleled opportunities to record animal movement across scales, and led to
the collection of ever-increasing quantities of tracking data. In parallel,
sophisticated tools to process, visualize and analyze tracking data have been
developed in abundance. Within the R software alone, we listed 57 focused on
these tasks, called here tracking packages. Here, we reviewed these tracking
packages, as an introduction to this set of packages for researchers, and to
provide feedback and recommendations to package developers, from a user
perspective. We described each package based on a workflow centered around
tracking data (i.e. (x,y,t)), broken down in three stages: pre-processing,
post-processing, and analysis (data visualization, track description, path
reconstruction, behavioral pattern identification, space use characterization,
trajectory simulation and others).
Supporting documentation is key to the accessibility of a package for users.
Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation, and
identified $12$ packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between
packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group
of packages shows some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or
suggesting the use of another tracking package), a third of tracking packages
work on isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the R Movement-Ecology
programming community.
Finally, we provide recommendations for users to choose packages, and for
developers to maximize usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the
links between the programming community.

"  Understanding the emergence of biological structures and their changes is a
complex problem. On a biochemical level, it is based on gene regulatory
networks (GRN) consisting on interactions between the genes responsible for
cell differentiation and coupled in a greater scale with external factors. In
this work we provide a systematic methodological framework to construct
Waddington's epigenetic landscape of the GRN involved in cellular determination
during the early stages of development of angiosperms. As a specific example we
consider the flower of the plant \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}. Our model,
which is based on experimental data, recovers accurately the spatial
configuration of the flower during cell fate determination, not only for the
wild type, but for its homeotic mutants as well. The method developed in this
project is general enough to be used in the study of the relationship between
genotype-phenotype in other living organisms.

"  Urban areas with larger and more connected populations offer an auspicious
environment for contagion processes such as the spread of pathogens. Empirical
evidence reveals a systematic increase in the rates of certain sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) with larger urban population size. However, the
main drivers of these systemic infection patterns are still not well
understood, and rampant urbanization rates worldwide makes it critical to
advance our understanding on this front. Using confirmed-cases data for three
STDs in US metropolitan areas, we investigate the scaling patterns of
infectious disease incidence in urban areas. The most salient features of these
patterns are that, on average, the incidence of infectious diseases that
transmit with less ease-- either because of a lower inherent transmissibility
or due to a less suitable environment for transmission-- scale more steeply
with population size, are less predictable across time and more variable across
cities of similar size. These features are explained, first, using a simple
mathematical model of contagion, and then through the lens of a new theory of
urban scaling. These theoretical frameworks help us reveal the links between
the factors that determine the transmissibility of infectious diseases and the
properties of their scaling patterns across cities.
"
"  The phenomenon of self-synchronization in populations of oscillatory units
appears naturally in neurosciences. However, in some situations, the formation
of a coherent state is damaging. In this article we study a repulsive
mean-field Kuramoto model that describes the time evolution of n points on the
unit circle, which are transformed into incoherent phase-locked states. It has
been recently shown that such systems can be reduced to a three-dimensional
system of ordinary differential equations, whose mathematical structure is
strongly related to hyperbolic geometry. The orbits of the Kuramoto dynamical
system are then described by a ow of Möbius transformations. We show this
underlying dynamic performs statistical inference by computing dynamically
M-estimates of scatter matrices. We also describe the limiting phase-locked
states for random initial conditions using Tyler's transformation matrix.
Moreover, we show the repulsive Kuramoto model performs dynamically not only
robust covariance matrix estimation, but also data processing: the initial
configuration of the n points is transformed by the dynamic into a limiting
phase-locked state that surprisingly equals the spatial signs from
nonparametric statistics. That makes the sign empirical covariance matrix to
equal 1 2 id2, the variance-covariance matrix of a random vector that is
uniformly distributed on the unit circle.

"  In lieu of an abstract here is the first paragraph: No other species remotely
approaches the human capacity for the cultural evolution of novelty that is
accumulative, adaptive, and open-ended (i.e., with no a priori limit on the
size or scope of possibilities). By culture we mean extrasomatic
adaptations--including behavior and technology--that are socially rather than
sexually transmitted. This chapter synthesizes research from anthropology,
psychology, archaeology, and agent-based modeling into a speculative yet
coherent account of two fundamental cognitive transitions underlying human
cultural evolution that is consistent with contemporary psychology. While the
chapter overlaps with a more technical paper on this topic (Gabora & Smith
2018), it incorporates new research and elaborates a genetic component to our
overall argument. The ideas in this chapter grew out of a non-Darwinian
framework for cultural evolution, referred to as the Self-other Reorganization
(SOR) theory of cultural evolution (Gabora, 2013, in press; Smith, 2013), which
was inspired by research on the origin and earliest stage in the evolution of
life (Cornish-Bowden & Cárdenas 2017; Goldenfeld, Biancalani, & Jafarpour,
2017, Vetsigian, Woese, & Goldenfeld 2006; Woese, 2002). SOR bridges
psychological research on fundamental aspects of our human nature such as
creativity and our proclivity to reflect on ideas from different perspectives,
with the literature on evolutionary approaches to cultural evolution that
aspire to synthesize the behavioral sciences much as has been done for the
biological scientists. The current chapter is complementary to this effort, but
less abstract; it attempts to ground the theory of cultural evolution in terms
of cognitive transitions as suggested by archaeological evidence.

"  Bottom-up and top-down, as well as low-level and high-level factors influence
where we fixate when viewing natural scenes. However, the importance of each of
these factors and how they interact remains a matter of debate. Here, we
disentangle these factors by analysing their influence over time. For this
purpose we develop a saliency model which is based on the internal
representation of a recent early spatial vision model to measure the low-level
bottom-up factor. To measure the influence of high-level bottom-up features, we
use a recent DNN-based saliency model. To account for top-down influences, we
evaluate the models on two large datasets with different tasks: first, a
memorisation task and, second, a search task. Our results lend support to a
separation of visual scene exploration into three phases: The first saccade, an
initial guided exploration characterised by a gradual broadening of the
fixation density, and an steady state which is reached after roughly 10
fixations. Saccade target selection during the initial exploration and in the
steady state are related to similar areas of interest, which are better
predicted when including high-level features. In the search dataset, fixation
locations are determined predominantly by top-down processes. In contrast, the
first fixation follows a different fixation density and contains a strong
central fixation bias. Nonetheless, first fixations are guided strongly by
image properties and as early as 200 ms after image onset, fixations are better
predicted by high-level information. We conclude that any low-level bottom-up
factors are mainly limited to the generation of the first saccade. All saccades
are better explained when high-level features are considered, and later this
high-level bottom-up control can be overruled by top-down influences.

"  While deep neural networks take loose inspiration from neuroscience, it is an
open question how seriously to take the analogies between artificial deep
networks and biological neuronal systems. Interestingly, recent work has shown
that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image
recognition tasks can serve as strikingly good models for predicting the
responses of neurons in visual cortex to visual stimuli, suggesting that
analogies between artificial and biological neural networks may be more than
superficial. However, while CNNs capture key properties of the average
responses of cortical neurons, they fail to explain other properties of these
neurons. For one, CNNs typically require large quantities of labeled input data
for training. Our own brains, in contrast, rarely have access to this kind of
supervision, so to the extent that representations are similar between CNNs and
brains, this similarity must arise via different training paths. In addition,
neurons in visual cortex produce complex time-varying responses even to static
inputs, and they dynamically tune themselves to temporal regularities in the
visual environment. We argue that these differences are clues to fundamental
differences between the computations performed in the brain and in deep
networks. To begin to close the gap, here we study the emergent properties of a
previously-described recurrent generative network that is trained to predict
future video frames in a self-supervised manner. Remarkably, the model is able
to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual
cortex, ranging from single unit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion
illusions. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent
predictive neural network models and the brain, providing new leads that can
enrich both fields.

"  Unraveling bacterial strategies for spatial exploration is crucial to
understand the complexity of the organi- zation of life. Currently, a
cornerstone for quantitative modeling of bacterial transport, is their
run-and-tumble strategy to explore their environment. For Escherichia coli, the
run time distribution was reported to follow a Poisson process with a single
characteristic time related to the rotational switching of the flagellar motor.
Direct measurements on flagellar motors show, on the contrary, heavy-tailed
distributions of rotation times stemming from the intrinsic noise in the
chemotactic mechanism. The crucial role of stochasticity on the chemotactic
response has also been highlighted by recent modeling, suggesting its
determinant influence on motility. In stark contrast with the accepted vision
of run-and-tumble, here we report a large behavioral variability of wild-type
E. coli, revealed in their three-dimensional trajectories. At short times, a
broad distribution of run times is measured on a population and attributed to
the slow fluctuations of a signaling protein triggering the flagellar motor
reversal. Over long times, individual bacteria undergo significant changes in
motility. We demonstrate that such a large distribution introduces measurement
biases in most practical situations. These results reconcile the notorious
conundrum between run time observations and motor switching statistics. We
finally propose that statistical modeling of transport properties currently
undertaken in the emerging framework of active matter studies should be
reconsidered under the scope of this large variability of motility features.
"
"  Time series, as frequently the case in neuroscience, are rarely stationary,
but often exhibit abrupt changes due to attractor transitions or bifurcations
in the dynamical systems producing them. A plethora of methods for detecting
such change points in time series statistics have been developed over the
years, in addition to test criteria to evaluate their significance. Issues to
consider when developing change point analysis methods include computational
demands, difficulties arising from either limited amount of data or a large
number of covariates, and arriving at statistical tests with sufficient power
to detect as many changes as contained in potentially high-dimensional time
series. Here, a general method called Paired Adaptive Regressors for Cumulative
Sum is developed for detecting multiple change points in the mean of
multivariate time series. The method's advantages over alternative approaches
are demonstrated through a series of simulation experiments. This is followed
by a real data application to neural recordings from rat medial prefrontal
cortex during learning. Finally, the method's flexibility to incorporate useful
features from state-of-the-art change point detection techniques is discussed,
along with potential drawbacks and suggestions to remedy them.

"  The evolution of structure in biology is driven by accretion and change.
Accretion brings together disparate parts to form bigger wholes. Change
provides opportunities for growth and innovation. Here we review patterns and
processes that are responsible for a 'double tale' of evolutionary accretion at
various levels of complexity, from proteins and nucleic acids to high-rise
building structures in cities. Parts are at first weakly linked and associate
variously. As they diversify, they compete with each other and are selected for
performance. The emerging interactions constrain their structure and
associations. This causes parts to self-organize into modules with tight
linkage. In a second phase, variants of the modules evolve and become new parts
for a new generative cycle of higher-level organization. Evolutionary genomics
and network biology support the 'double tale' of structural module creation and
validate an evolutionary principle of maximum abundance that drives the gain
and loss of modules.

"  Neural circuits in the retina divide the incoming visual scene into more than
a dozen distinct representations that are sent on to central brain areas, such
as the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus. The retina can
be viewed as a parallel image processor made of a multitude of small
computational devices. Neural circuits of the retina are constituted by various
cell types that separate the incoming visual information in different channels.
Visual information is processed by retinal neural circuits and several
computations are performed extracting distinct features from the visual scene.
The aim of this article is to understand the computational basis involved in
processing visual information which finally leads to several feature detectors.
Therefore, the elements that form the basis of retinal computations will be
explored by explaining how oscillators can lead to a final output with
computational meaning. Linear versus nonlinear systems will be presented and
the retina will be placed in the context of a nonlinear system. Finally,
simulations will be presented exploring the concept of the retina as a
nonlinear system which can perform understandable computations converting a
known input into a predictable output.

"  Identifying significant subsets of the genes, gene shaving is an essential
and challenging issue for biomedical research for a huge number of genes and
the complex nature of biological networks,. Since positive definite kernel
based methods on genomic information can improve the prediction of diseases, in
this paper we proposed a new method, ""kernel gene shaving (kernel canonical
correlation analysis (kernel CCA) based gene shaving). This problem is
addressed using the influence function of the kernel CCA. To investigate the
performance of the proposed method in a comparison of three popular gene
selection methods (T-test, SAM and LIMMA), we were used extensive simulated and
real microarray gene expression datasets. The performance measures AUC was
computed for each of the methods. The achievement of the proposed method has
improved than the three well-known gene selection methods. In real data
analysis, the proposed method identified a subsets of $210$ genes out of $2000$
genes. The network of these genes has significantly more interactions than
expected, which indicates that they may function in a concerted effort on colon
cancer.

"  Deep neural networks (DNNs) transform stimuli across multiple processing
stages to produce representations that can be used to solve complex tasks, such
as object recognition in images. However, a full understanding of how they
achieve this remains elusive. The complexity of biological neural networks
substantially exceeds the complexity of DNNs, making it even more challenging
to understand the representations that they learn. Thus, both machine learning
and computational neuroscience are faced with a shared challenge: how can we
analyze their representations in order to understand how they solve complex
tasks?
We review how data-analysis concepts and techniques developed by
computational neuroscientists can be useful for analyzing representations in
DNNs, and in turn, how recently developed techniques for analysis of DNNs can
be useful for understanding representations in biological neural networks. We
explore opportunities for synergy between the two fields, such as the use of
DNNs as in-silico model systems for neuroscience, and how this synergy can lead
to new hypotheses about the operating principles of biological neural networks.

"  Temporal resolution of visual information processing is thought to be an
important factor in predator-prey interactions, shaped in the course of
evolution by animals' ecology. Here I show that light can be considered to have
a dual role of a source of information, which guides motor actions, and an
environmental feedback for those actions. I consequently show how temporal
perception might depend on behavioral adaptations realized by the nervous
system. I propose an underlying mechanism of synaptic clock, with every synapse
having its characteristic time unit, determined by the persistence of memory
traces of synaptic inputs, which is used by the synapse to tell time. The
present theory offers a testable framework, which may account for numerous
experimental findings, including the interspecies variation in temporal
resolution and the properties of subjective time perception, specifically the
variable speed of perceived time passage, depending on emotional and
attentional states or tasks performed.

"  Neuronal activity in the brain generates synchronous oscillations of the
Local Field Potential (LFP). The traditional analyses of the LFPs are based on
decomposing the signal into simpler components, such as sinusoidal harmonics.
However, a common drawback of such methods is that the decomposition primitives
are usually presumed from the onset, which may bias our understanding of the
signal's structure. Here, we introduce an alternative approach that allows an
impartial, high resolution, hands-off decomposition of the brain waves into a
small number of discrete, frequency-modulated oscillatory processes, which we
call oscillons. In particular, we demonstrate that mouse hippocampal LFP
contain a single oscillon that occupies the $\theta$-frequency band and a
couple of $\gamma$-oscillons that correspond, respectively, to slow and fast
$\gamma$-waves. Since the oscillons were identified empirically, they may
represent the actual, physical structure of synchronous oscillations in
neuronal ensembles, whereas Fourier-defined ""brain waves"" are nothing but
poorly resolved oscillons.

"  Language change involves the competition between alternative linguistic forms
(1). The spontaneous evolution of these forms typically results in monotonic
growths or decays (2, 3) like in winner-take-all attractor behaviors. In the
case of the Spanish past subjunctive, the spontaneous evolution of its two
competing forms (ended in -ra and -se) was perturbed by the appearance of the
Royal Spanish Academy in 1713, which enforced the spelling of both forms as
perfectly interchangeable variants (4), at a moment in which the -ra form was
dominant (5). Time series extracted from a massive corpus of books (6) reveal
that this regulation in fact produced a transient renewed interest for the old
form -se which, once faded, left the -ra again as the dominant form up to the
present day. We show that time series are successfully explained by a
two-dimensional linear model that integrates an imitative and a novelty
component. The model reveals that the temporal scale over which collective
attention fades is in inverse proportion to the verb frequency. The integration
of the two basic mechanisms of imitation and attention to novelty allows to
understand diverse competing objects, with lifetimes that range from hours for
memes and news (7, 8) to decades for verbs, suggesting the existence of a
general mechanism underlying cultural evolution.

"  We present a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, implemented in software
Arbores, for inferring the history of a sample of DNA sequences. Our principal
innovation is a bridging procedure, previously applied only for simple
stochastic processes, in which the local computations within a bridge can
proceed independently of the rest of the DNA sequence, facilitating large-scale
parallelisation.

"  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are becoming increasingly popular
models to predict neural responses in visual cortex. However, contextual
effects, which are prevalent in neural processing and in perception, are not
explicitly handled by current CNNs, including those used for neural prediction.
In primary visual cortex, neural responses are modulated by stimuli spatially
surrounding the classical receptive field in rich ways. These effects have been
modeled with divisive normalization approaches, including flexible models,
where spatial normalization is recruited only to the degree responses from
center and surround locations are deemed statistically dependent. We propose a
flexible normalization model applied to mid-level representations of deep CNNs
as a tractable way to study contextual normalization mechanisms in mid-level
cortical areas. This approach captures non-trivial spatial dependencies among
mid-level features in CNNs, such as those present in textures and other visual
stimuli, that arise from tiling high order features, geometrically. We expect
that the proposed approach can make predictions about when spatial
normalization might be recruited in mid-level cortical areas. We also expect
this approach to be useful as part of the CNN toolkit, therefore going beyond
more restrictive fixed forms of normalization.

"  Electrical forces are the background of all the interactions occurring in
biochemical systems. From here and by using a combination of ab-initio and
ad-hoc models, we introduce the first description of electric field profiles
with intrabond resolution to support a characterization of single bond forces
attending to its electrical origin. This fundamental issue has eluded a
physical description so far. Our method is applied to describe hydrogen bonds
(HB) in DNA base pairs. Numerical results reveal that base pairs in DNA could
be equivalent considering HB strength contributions, which challenges previous
interpretations of thermodynamic properties of DNA based on the assumption that
Adenine/Thymine pairs are weaker than Guanine/Cytosine pairs due to the sole
difference in the number of HB. Thus, our methodology provides solid
foundations to support the development of extended models intended to go deeper
into the molecular mechanisms of DNA functioning.

"  This paper is based on the complete classification of evolutionary scenarios
for the Moran process with two strategies given by Taylor et al. (B. Math.
Biol. 66(6): 1621--1644, 2004). Their classification is based on whether each
strategy is a Nash equilibrium and whether the fixation probability for a
single individual of each strategy is larger or smaller than its value for
neutral evolution. We improve on this analysis by showing that each
evolutionary scenario is characterized by a definite graph shape for the
fixation probability function. A second class of results deals with the
behavior of the fixation probability when the population size tends to
infinity. We develop asymptotic formulae that approximate the fixation
probability in this limit and conclude that some of the evolutionary scenarios
cannot exist when the population size is large.
"
"  We present a new method that combines alchemical transformation with physical
pathway to accurately and efficiently compute the absolute binding free energy
of receptor-ligand complex. Currently, the double decoupling method (DDM) and
the potential of mean force approach (PMF) methods are widely used to compute
the absolute binding free energy of biomolecules. The DDM relies on
alchemically decoupling the ligand from its environments, which can be
computationally challenging for large ligands and charged ligands because of
the large magnitude of the decoupling free energies involved. On the other
hand, the PMF approach uses physical pathway to extract the ligand out of the
binding site, thus avoids the alchemical decoupling of the ligand. However, the
PMF method has its own drawback because of the reliance on a ligand
binding/unbinding pathway free of steric obstruction from the receptor atoms.
Therefore, in the presence of deeply buried ligand functional groups the
convergence of the PMF calculation can be very slow leading to large errors in
the computed binding free energy. Here we develop a new method called AlchemPMF
by combining alchemical transformation with physical pathway to overcome the
major drawback in the PMF method. We have tested the new approach on the
binding of a charged ligand to an allosteric site on HIV-1 Integrase. After 20
ns of simulation per umbrella sampling window, the new method yields absolute
binding free energies within ~1 kcal/mol from the experimental result, whereas
the standard PMF approach and the DDM calculations result in errors of ~5
kcal/mol and > 2 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, the binding free energy
computed using the new method is associated with smaller statistical error
compared with those obtained from the existing methods.
"
"  The flexibility of short DNA chains is investigated via computation of the
average correlation function between dimers which defines the persistence
length. Path integration techniques have been applied to confine the phase
space available to base pair fluctuations and derive the partition function.
The apparent persistence lengths of a set of short chains have been computed as
a function of the twist conformation both in the over-twisted and the untwisted
regimes, whereby the equilibrium twist is selected by free energy minimization.
The obtained values are significantly lower than those generally attributed to
kilo-base long DNA. This points to an intrinsic helix flexibility at short
length scales, arising from large fluctuational effects and local bending, in
line with recent experimental indications. The interplay between helical
untwisting and persistence length has been discussed for a heterogeneous
fragment by weighing the effects of the sequence specificities through the
non-linear stacking potential.

"  Life can be viewed as a localized chemical system that sits on, or in the
basin of attraction of, a metastable dynamical attractor state that remains out
of equilibrium with the environment. Such a view of life allows that new living
states can arise through chance changes in local chemical concentration
(=mutations) that move points in space into the basin of attraction of a life
state - the attractor being an autocatalytic sets whose essential (=keystone)
species are produced at a higher rate than they are lost to the environment by
diffusion, such that growth in expected. This conception of life yields several
new insights and conjectures. (1) This framework suggests that the first new
life states to arise are likely at interfaces where the rate of diffusion of
keystone species is tied to a low-diffusion regime, while precursors and waste
products diffuse at a higher rate. (2) There are reasons to expect that once
the first life state arises, most likely on a mineral surface, additional
mutations will generate derived life states with which the original state will
compete. (3) I propose that in the resulting adaptive process there is a
general tendency for higher complexity life states (i.e., ones that are further
from being at equilibrium with the environment) to dominate a given mineral
surface. (4) The framework suggests a simple and predictable path by which
cells evolve and provides pointers on why such cells are likely to acquire
particulate inheritance. Overall, the dynamical systems theoretical framework
developed provides an integrated view of the origin and early evolution of life
and supports novel empirical approaches.

"  Dynamically crosslinked semiflexible biopolymers such as the actin
cytoskeleton govern the mechanical behavior of living cells. Semiflexible
biopolymers stiffen nonlinearly in response to mechanical loads, whereas the
crosslinker dynamics allow for stress relaxation over time. Here we show,
through rheology and theoretical modeling, that the combined nonlinearity in
time and stress leads to an unexpectedly slow stress relaxation, similar to the
dynamics of disordered systems close to the glass transition. Our work suggests
that transient crosslinking combined with internal stress is the microscopic
origin for the universal glassy dynamics as frequently observed in cellular
mechanics.
"
"  We answer two questions raised by Bryant, Francis and Steel in their work on
consensus methods in phylogenetics. Consensus methods apply to every practical
instance where it is desired to aggregate a set of given phylogenetic trees
(say, gene evolution trees) into a resulting, ""consensus"" tree (say, a species
tree). Various stability criteria have been explored in this context, seeking
to model desirable consistency properties of consensus methods as the
experimental data is updated (e.g., more taxa, or more trees, are mapped).
However, such stability conditions can be incompatible with some basic
regularity properties that are widely accepted to be essential in any
meaningful consensus method. Here, we prove that such an incompatibility does
arise in the case of extension stability on binary trees and in the case of
associative stability. Our methods combine general theoretical considerations
with the use of computer programs tailored to the given stability requirements.

"  It is true that the ""best"" neural network is not necessarily the one with the
most ""brain-like"" behavior. Understanding biological intelligence, however, is
a fundamental goal for several distinct disciplines. Translating our
understanding of intelligence to machines is a fundamental problem in robotics.
Propelled by new advancements in Neuroscience, we developed a spiking neural
network (SNN) that draws from mounting experimental evidence that a number of
individual neurons is associated with spatial navigation. By following the
brain's structure, our model assumes no initial all-to-all connectivity, which
could inhibit its translation to a neuromorphic hardware, and learns an
uncharted territory by mapping its identified components into a limited number
of neural representations, through spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). In
our ongoing effort to employ a bioinspired SNN-controlled robot to real-world
spatial mapping applications, we demonstrate here how an SNN may robustly
control an autonomous robot in mapping and exploring an unknown environment,
while compensating for its own intrinsic hardware imperfections, such as
partial or total loss of visual input.
"
"  Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an effective tool for the analysis of
structural brain connectivity in normal development and in a broad range of
brain disorders. However efforts to derive inherent characteristics of
structural brain networks have been hampered by the very high dimensionality of
the data, relatively small sample sizes, and the lack of widely acceptable
connectivity-based regions of interests (ROIs). Typical approaches have focused
either on regions defined by standard anatomical atlases that do not
incorporate anatomical connectivity, or have been based on voxel-wise analysis,
which results in loss of statistical power relative to structure-wise
connectivity analysis. In this work, we propose a novel, computationally
efficient iterative clustering method to generate connectivity-based
whole-brain parcellations that converge to a stable parcellation in a few
iterations. Our algorithm is based on a sparse representation of the whole
brain connectivity matrix, which reduces the number of edges from around a half
billion to a few million while incorporating the necessary spatial constraints.
We show that the resulting regions in a sense capture the inherent connectivity
information present in the data, and are stable with respect to initialization
and the randomization scheme within the algorithm. These parcellations provide
consistent structural regions across the subjects of population samples that
are homogeneous with respect to anatomic connectivity. Our method also derives
connectivity structures that can be used to distinguish between population
samples with known different structural connectivity. In particular, new
results in structural differences for different population samples such as
Females vs Males, Normal Controls vs Schizophrenia, and different age groups in
Normal Controls are also shown.

"  Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic
network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly
synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic
zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied
patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients
with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each
personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes
equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a
range of epileptiform discharges. Each patients virtual brain was further
personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ.
Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and
uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients,
we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the
subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii)seizure propagation is
characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can
be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the
degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the here proposed
seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures,
neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability
analysis of the network dynamics using graph theoretical metrics estimates
reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests
novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage
partial epilepsy.
"
"  The central problem with understanding brain and mind is the neural code
issue: understanding the matter of our brain as basis for the phenomena of our
mind. The richness with which our mind represents our environment, the
parsimony of genetic data, the tremendous efficiency with which the brain
learns from scant sensory input and the creativity with which our mind
constructs mental worlds all speak in favor of mind as an emergent phenomenon.
This raises the further issue of how the neural code supports these processes
of organization. The central point of this communication is that the neural
code has the form of structured net fragments that are formed by network
self-organization, activate and de-activate on the functional time scale, and
spontaneously combine to form larger nets with the same basic structure.
"
"  The importance of microscopic details on cooperation level is an intensively
studied aspect of evolutionary game theory. Interestingly, these details become
crucial on heterogeneous populations where individuals may possess diverse
traits. By introducing a coevolutionary model in which not only strategies but
also individual dynamical features may evolve we revealed that the formerly
established conclusion is not necessarily true when different updating rules
are on stage. In particular, we apply two strategy updating rules, imitation
and Death-Birth rule, which allow local selection in a spatial system. Our
observation highlights that the microscopic feature of dynamics, like the level
of learning activity, could be a fundamental factor even if all players share
the same trait uniformly.
"
"  Electrophysiological recordings of spiking activity are limited to a small
number of neurons. This spatial subsampling has hindered characterizing even
most basic properties of collective spiking in cortical networks. In
particular, two contradictory hypotheses prevailed for over a decade: the first
proposed an asynchronous irregular state, the second a critical state. While
distinguishing them is straightforward in models, we show that in experiments
classical approaches fail to correctly infer network dynamics because of
subsampling. Deploying a novel, subsampling-invariant estimator, we find that
in vivo dynamics do not comply with either hypothesis, but instead occupy a
narrow ""reverberating"" state consistently across multiple mammalian species and
cortical areas. A generic model tuned to this reverberating state predicts
single neuron, pairwise, and population properties. With these predictions we
first validate the model and then deduce network properties that are
challenging to obtain experimentally, like the network timescale and strength
of cortical input.
"
"  Understanding information processing in the brain requires the ability to
determine the functional connectivity between the different regions of the
brain. We present a method using transfer entropy to extract this flow of
information between brain regions from spike-train data commonly obtained in
neurological experiments. Transfer entropy is a statistical measure based in
information theory that attempts to quantify the information flow from one
process to another, and has been applied to find connectivity in simulated
spike-train data. Due to statistical error in the estimator, inferring
functional connectivity requires a method for determining significance in the
transfer entropy values. We discuss the issues with numerical estimation of
transfer entropy and resulting challenges in determining significance before
presenting the trial-shuffle method as a viable option. The trial-shuffle
method, for spike-train data that is split into multiple trials, determines
significant transfer entropy values independently for each individual pair of
neurons by comparing to a created baseline distribution using a rigorous
statistical test. This is in contrast to either globally comparing all neuron
transfer entropy values or comparing pairwise values to a single baseline
value.
In establishing the viability of this method by comparison to several
alternative approaches in the literature, we find evidence that preserving the
inter-spike-interval timing is important.
We then use the trial-shuffle method to investigate information flow within a
model network as we vary model parameters. This includes investigating the
global flow of information within a connectivity network divided into two
well-connected subnetworks, going beyond local transfer of information between
pairs of neurons.

"  A key objective in two phase 2b AMP clinical trials of VRC01 is to evaluate
whether drug concentration over time, as estimated by non-linear mixed effects
pharmacokinetics (PK) models, is associated with HIV infection rate. We
conducted a simulation study of marker sampling designs, and evaluated the
effect of study adherence and sub-cohort sample size on PK model estimates in
multiple-dose studies. With m=120, even under low adherence (about half of
study visits missing per participant), reasonably unbiased and consistent
estimates of most fixed and random effect terms were obtained. Coarsened marker
sampling schedules were also studied.
"
"  In structured populations the spatial arrangement of cooperators and
defectors on the interaction graph together with the structure of the graph
itself determines the game dynamics and particularly whether or not fixation of
cooperation (or defection) is favored. For a single cooperator (and a single
defector) and a network described by a regular graph the question of fixation
can be addressed by a single parameter, the structure coefficient. As this
quantity is generic for any regular graph, we may call it the generic structure
coefficient. For two and more cooperators (or several defectors) fixation
properties can also be assigned by structure coefficients. These structure
coefficients, however, depend on the arrangement of cooperators and defectors
which we may interpret as a configuration of the game. Moreover, the
coefficients are specific for a given interaction network modeled as regular
graph, which is why we may call them specific structure coefficients. In this
paper, we study how specific structure coefficients vary over interaction
graphs and link the distributions obtained over different graphs to spectral
properties of interaction networks. We also discuss implications for the
benefit-to-cost ratios of donation games.

"  Evolutionary modeling applications are the best way to provide full
information to support in-depth understanding of evaluation of organisms. These
applications mainly depend on identifying the evolutionary history of existing
organisms and understanding the relations between them, which is possible
through the deep analysis of their biological sequences. Multiple Sequence
Alignment (MSA) is considered an important tool in such applications, where it
gives an accurate representation of the relations between different biological
sequences. In literature, many efforts have been put into presenting a new MSA
algorithm or even improving existing ones. However, little efforts on
optimizing parallel MSA algorithms have been done. Nowadays, large datasets
become a reality, and big data become a primary challenge in various fields,
which should be also a new milestone for new bioinformatics algorithms. This
survey presents four of the state-of-the-art parallel MSA algorithms, TCoffee,
MAFFT, MSAProbs, and M2Align. We provide a detailed discussion of each
algorithm including its strengths, weaknesses, and implementation details and
the effectiveness of its parallel implementation compared to the other
algorithms, taking into account the MSA accuracy on two different datasets,
BAliBASE and OXBench.

"  We introduce a Unified Disentanglement Network (UFDN) trained on The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). We demonstrate that the UFDN learns a biologically
relevant latent space of gene expression data by applying our network to two
classification tasks of cancer status and cancer type. Our UFDN specific
algorithms perform comparably to random forest methods. The UFDN allows for
continuous, partial interpolation between distinct cancer types. Furthermore,
we perform an analysis of differentially expressed genes between skin cutaneous
melanoma(SKCM) samples and the same samples interpolated into glioblastoma
(GBM). We demonstrate that our interpolations learn relevant metagenes that
recapitulate known glioblastoma mechanisms and suggest possible starting points
for investigations into the metastasis of SKCM into GBM.
"
"  Many recent studies of the motor system are divided into two distinct
approaches: Those that investigate how motor responses are encoded in cortical
neurons' firing rate dynamics and those that study the learning rules by which
mammals and songbirds develop reliable motor responses. Computationally, the
first approach is encapsulated by reservoir computing models, which can learn
intricate motor tasks and produce internal dynamics strikingly similar to those
of motor cortical neurons, but rely on biologically unrealistic learning rules.
The more realistic learning rules developed by the second approach are often
derived for simplified, discrete tasks in contrast to the intricate dynamics
that characterize real motor responses. We bridge these two approaches to
develop a biologically realistic learning rule for reservoir computing. Our
algorithm learns simulated motor tasks on which previous reservoir computing
algorithms fail, and reproduces experimental findings including those that
relate motor learning to Parkinson's disease and its treatment.
"
"  We first review traditional approaches to memory storage and formation,
drawing on the literature of quantitative neuroscience as well as statistical
physics. These have generally focused on the fast dynamics of neurons; however,
there is now an increasing emphasis on the slow dynamics of synapses, whose
weight changes are held to be responsible for memory storage. An important
first step in this direction was taken in the context of Fusi's cascade model,
where complex synaptic architectures were invoked, in particular, to store
long-term memories. No explicit synaptic dynamics were, however, invoked in
that work. These were recently incorporated theoretically using the techniques
used in agent-based modelling, and subsequently, models of competing and
cooperating synapses were formulated. It was found that the key to the storage
of long-term memories lay in the competitive dynamics of synapses. In this
review, we focus on models of synaptic competition and cooperation, and look at
the outstanding challenges that remain.
"
"  In this article we study the stabilizing of a primitive pattern of behaviour
for the two-species community with chemotaxis due to the short-wavelength
external signal. We use a system of Patlak-Keller-Segel type as a model of the
community. It is well-known that such systems can produce complex unsteady
patterns of behaviour which are usually explained mathematically by
bifurcations of some basic solutions that describe simpler patterns. As far as
we aware, all such bifurcations in the models of the Patlak-Keller-Segel type
had been found for homogeneous (i.e. translationally invariant) systems where
the basic solutions are equilibria with homogeneous distributions of all
species. The model considered in the present paper does not possess the
translational invariance: one of species (the predators) is assumed to be
capable of moving in response to a signal produced externally in addition to
the signal emitted by another species (the prey). For instance, the external
signal may arise from the inhomogeneity of the distribution of an environmental
characteristic such as temperature, salinity, terrain relief, etc. Our goal is
to examine the effect of short-wavelength inhomogeneity. To do this, we employ
a certain homogenization procedure. We separate the short-wavelength and smooth
components of the system response and derive a slow system governing the latter
one. Analysing the slow system and comparing it with the case of homogeneous
environment shows that, generically, a short-wavelength inhomogeneity results
in an exponential decrease in the motility of the predators. The loss of
motility prevents, to a great extent, the occurrence of complex unsteady
patterns and dramatically stabilizes the primitive basic solution. In some
sense, the necessity of dealing with intensive small-scale changes of the
environment makes the system unable to respond to other challenges.
"
"  Objective: To establish the performance of several drive and measurement
patterns in EIT imaging of neural activity in peripheral nerve, which involves
large impedance change in the nerve's anisotropic length axis. Approach: Eight
drive and measurement electrode patterns are compared using a finite element
(FE) four cylindrical shell model of a peripheral nerve and a 32 channel
dual-ring nerve cuff. The central layer of the FE model contains impedance
changes representative of neural activity of -0.3 in the length axis and -8.8 x
10-4 in the radial axis. Four of the electrode patterns generate longitudinal
drive current, which runs perpendicular to the anisotropic axis. Main results:
Transverse current patterns produce higher resolution than longitudinal
patterns but are also more susceptible to noise and errors, and exhibit poorer
sensitivity to impedance changes in central sample locations. Three of the four
longitudinal current patterns considered can reconstruct fascicle level
impedance changes with up to 0.2 mV noise and error, which corresponds to
between -5.5 and +0.18 dB of the normalised signal standard deviation. Reducing
the spacing between the two electrode rings in all longitudinal current
patterns reduced the signal to error ratio across all depth locations of the
sample. Significance: Electrode patterns which target the large impedance
change in the anisotropic length axis can provide improved robustness against
noise and errors, which is a critical step towards real time EIT imaging of
neural activity in peripheral nerve.

"  A luminous stimulus which penetrates in a retina is converted to a nerve
message. Ganglion cells give a response that may be approximated by a wavelet.
We determine a function PSI which is associated with the propagation of nerve
impulses along an axon. Each kind of channel (inward and outward) may be open
or closed, depending on the transmembrane potential. The transition between
these states is a random event. Using quantum relations, we estimate the number
of channels susceptible to switch between the closed and open states. Our
quantum approach was first to calculate the energy level distribution in a
channel. We obtain, for each kind of channel, the empty level density and the
filled level density of the open and closed conformations. The joint density of
levels provides the transition number between the closed and open
conformations. The algebraic sum of inward and outward open channels is a
function PSI of the normalized energy E. The function PSI verifies the major
properties of a wavelet. We calculate the functional dependence of the axon
membrane conductance with the transmembrane energy.
"
"  The two major approaches to studying macroevolution in deep time are the
fossil record and reconstructed relationships among extant taxa from molecular
data. Results based on one approach sometimes conflict with those based on the
other, with inconsistencies often attributed to inherent flaws of one (or the
other) data source. What is unquestionable is that both the molecular and
fossil records are limited reflections of the same evolutionary history, and
any contradiction between them represents a failure of our existing models to
explain the patterns we observe. Fortunately, the different limitations of each
record provide an opportunity to test or calibrate the other, and new
methodological developments leverage both records simultaneously. However, we
must reckon with the distinct relationships between sampling and time in the
fossil record and molecular phylogenies. These differences impact our
recognition of baselines, and the analytical incorporation of age estimate
uncertainty. These differences in perspective also influence how different
practitioners view the past and evolutionary time itself, bearing important
implications for the generality of methodological advancements, and differences
in the philosophical approach to macroevolutionary theory across fields.

"  Electrical brain stimulation is currently being investigated as a therapy for
neurological disease. However, opportunities to optimize such therapies are
challenged by the fact that the beneficial impact of focal stimulation on both
neighboring and distant regions is not well understood. Here, we use network
control theory to build a model of brain network function that makes
predictions about how stimulation spreads through the brain's white matter
network and influences large-scale dynamics. We test these predictions using
combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data
who volunteered to participate in an extensive stimulation regimen. We posit a
specific model-based manner in which white matter tracts constrain stimulation,
defining its capacity to drive the brain to new states, including states
associated with successful memory encoding. In a first validation of our model,
we find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more
accurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical
stimulation than the artificial patterns of null models. We then use a targeted
optimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the
brain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger
energy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a
target memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural
properties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on
energy requirements. Our work demonstrates that individual white matter
architecture plays a vital role in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical
stimulation, more generally offering empirical support for the utility of
network control theoretic models of brain response to stimulation.

"  Recent experiments suggest that the interplay between cells and the mechanics
of their substrate gives rise to a diversity of morphological and migrational
behaviors. Here, we develop a Cellular Potts Model of polarizing cells on a
visco-elastic substrate. We compare our model with experiments on endothelial
cells plated on polyacrylamide hydrogels to constrain model parameters and test
predictions. Our analysis reveals that morphology and migratory behavior are
determined by an intricate interplay between cellular polarization and
substrate strain gradients generated by traction forces exerted by cells
(self-haptotaxis).

"  Motile organisms often use finite spatial perception of their surroundings to
navigate and search their habitats. Yet standard models of search are usually
based on purely local sensory information. To model how a finite perceptual
horizon affects ecological search, we propose a framework for optimal
navigation that combines concepts from random walks and optimal control theory.
We show that, while local strategies are optimal on asymptotically long and
short search times, finite perception yields faster convergence and increased
search efficiency over transient time scales relevant in biological systems.
The benefit of the finite horizon can be maintained by the searchers tuning
their response sensitivity to the length scale of the stimulant in the
environment, and is enhanced when the agents interact as a result of increased
consensus within subpopulations. Our framework sheds light on the role of
spatial perception and transients in search movement and collective sensing of
the environment.

"  In this paper we consider the continuous mathematical model of tumour growth
and invasion based on the model introduced by Anderson, Chaplain et al.
\cite{Anderson&Chaplain2000}, for the case of one space dimension. The model
consists of a system of three coupled nonlinear reaction-diffusion-taxis
partial differential equations describing the interactions between cancer
cells, the matrix degrading enzyme and the tissue. For this model under certain
conditions on the model parameters we obtain the exact analytical solutions in
terms of traveling wave variables. These solutions are smooth positive definite
functions whose profiles agree with those obtained from numerical computations
\cite{Chaplain&Lolas2006} for not very large time intervals.

"  Reliable diagnosis of depressive disorder is essential for both optimal
treatment and prevention of fatal outcomes. In this study, we aimed to
elucidate the effectiveness of two non-linear measures, Higuchi Fractal
Dimension (HFD) and Sample Entropy (SampEn), in detecting depressive disorders
when applied on EEG. HFD and SampEn of EEG signals were used as features for
seven machine learning algorithms including Multilayer Perceptron, Logistic
Regression, Support Vector Machines with the linear and polynomial kernel,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifier, discriminating EEG
between healthy control subjects and patients diagnosed with depression. We
confirmed earlier observations that both non-linear measures can discriminate
EEG signals of patients from healthy control subjects. The results suggest that
good classification is possible even with a small number of principal
components. Average accuracy among classifiers ranged from 90.24% to 97.56%.
Among the two measures, SampEn had better performance. Using HFD and SampEn and
a variety of machine learning techniques we can accurately discriminate
patients diagnosed with depression vs controls which can serve as a highly
sensitive, clinically relevant marker for the diagnosis of depressive
disorders.

"  In recent era prediction of enzyme class from an unknown protein is one of
the challenging tasks in bioinformatics. Day to day the number of proteins is
increases as result the prediction of enzyme class gives a new opportunity to
bioinformatics scholars. The prime objective of this article is to implement
the machine learning classification technique for feature selection and
predictions also find out an appropriate classification technique for function
prediction. In this article the seven different classification technique like
CRT, QUEST, CHAID, C5.0, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), SVM and Bayesian has
been implemented on 4368 protein data that has been extracted from UniprotKB
databank and categories into six different class. The proteins data is high
dimensional sequence data and contain a maximum of 48 features.To manipulate
the high dimensional sequential protein data with different classification
technique, the SPSS has been used as an experimental tool. Different
classification techniques give different results for every model and shows that
the data are imbalanced for class C4, C5 and C6. The imbalanced data affect the
performance of model. In these three classes the precision and recall value is
very less or negligible. The experimental results highlight that the C5.0
classification technique accuracy is more suited for protein feature
classification and predictions. The C5.0 classification technique gives 95.56%
accuracy and also gives high precision and recall value. Finally, we conclude
that the features that is selected can be used for function prediction.

"  Psychiatric neuroscience is increasingly aware of the need to define
psychopathology in terms of abnormal neural computation. The central tool in
this endeavour is the fitting of computational models to behavioural data. The
most prominent example of this procedure is fitting reinforcement learning (RL)
models to decision-making data collected from mentally ill and healthy subject
populations. These models are generative models of the decision-making data
themselves, and the parameters we seek to infer can be psychologically and
neurobiologically meaningful. Currently, the gold standard approach to this
inference procedure involves Monte-Carlo sampling, which is robust but
computationally intensive---rendering additional procedures, such as
cross-validation, impractical. Searching for point estimates of model
parameters using optimization procedures remains a popular and interesting
option. On a novel testbed simulating parameter estimation from a common RL
task, we investigated the effects of smooth vs. boundary constraints on
parameter estimation using interior point and deterministic direct search
algorithms for optimization. Ultimately, we show that the use of boundary
constraints can lead to substantial truncation effects. Our results discourage
the use of boundary constraints for these applications.

"  Reconstructing network connectivity from the collective dynamics of a system
typically requires access to its complete continuous-time evolution although
these are often experimentally inaccessible. Here we propose a theory for
revealing physical connectivity of networked systems only from the event time
series their intrinsic collective dynamics generate. Representing the patterns
of event timings in an event space spanned by inter-event and cross-event
intervals, we reveal which other units directly influence the inter-event times
of any given unit. For illustration, we linearize an event space mapping
constructed from the spiking patterns in model neural circuits to reveal the
presence or absence of synapses between any pair of neurons as well as whether
the coupling acts in an inhibiting or activating (excitatory) manner. The
proposed model-independent reconstruction theory is scalable to larger networks
and may thus play an important role in the reconstruction of networks from
biology to social science and engineering.

"  The impact of information dissemination on epidemic control essentially
affects individual behaviors. Among the information-driven behaviors,
vaccination is determined by the cost-related factors, and the correlation with
information dissemination is not clear yet. To this end, we present a model to
integrate the information-epidemic spread process into an evolutionary
vaccination game in multiplex networks, and explore how the spread of
information on epidemic influences the vaccination behavior. We propose a
two-layer coupled susceptible-alert-infected-susceptible (SAIS) model on a
multiplex network, where the strength coefficient is defined to characterize
the tendency and intensity of information dissemination. By means of the
evolutionary game theory, we get the equilibrium vaccination level (the
evolutionary stable strategy) for the vaccination game. After exploring the
influence of the strength coefficient on the equilibrium vaccination level, we
reach a counter-intuitive conclusion that more information transmission cannot
promote vaccination. Specifically, when the vaccination cost is within a
certain range, increasing information dissemination even leads to a decline in
the equilibrium vaccination level. Moreover, we study the influence of the
strength coefficient on the infection density and social cost, and unveil the
role of information dissemination in controlling the epidemic with numerical
simulations.

"  Tumor stromal interactions have been shown to be the driving force behind the
poor prognosis associated with aggressive breast tumors. These interactions,
specifically between tumor and the surrounding ECM, and tumor and vascular
endothelium, promote tumor formation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In this
study, we develop an in vitro vascularized tumor platform that allows for
investigation of tumor-stromal interactions in three breast tumor derived cell
lines of varying aggressiveness: MDA-IBC3, SUM149, and MDA-MB-231. The platform
recreates key features of breast tumors, including increased vascular
permeability, vessel sprouting, and ECM remodeling. Morphological and
quantitative analysis reveals differential effects from each tumor cell type on
endothelial coverage, permeability, expression of VEGF, and collagen
remodeling. Triple negative tumors, SUM149 and MDA-MB-321, resulted in a
significantly (p<0.05) higher endothelial permeability and decreased
endothelial coverage compared to the control TIME only platform. SUM149/TIME
platforms were 1.3 fold lower (p<0.05), and MDA-MB-231/TIME platforms were 1.5
fold lower (p<0.01) in endothelial coverage compared to the control TIME only
platform. HER2+ MDA-IBC3 tumor cells expressed high levels of VEGF (p<0.01) and
induced vessel sprouting. Vessels sprouting was tracked for 3 weeks and with
increasing time exhibited formation of multiple vessel sprouts that invaded
into the ECM and surrounded clusters of MDA-IBC3 cells. Both IBC cell lines,
SUM149 and MDA-IBC3, resulted in a collagen ECM with significantly greater
porosity with 1.6 and 1.1 fold higher compared to control, p<0.01. The breast
cancer in vitro vascularized platforms introduced in this paper are an
adaptable, high throughout tool for unearthing tumor-stromal mechanisms and
dynamics behind tumor progression and may prove essential in developing
effective targeted therapeutics.

"  Phylodynamics is an area of population genetics that uses genetic sequence
data to estimate past population dynamics. Modern state-of-the-art Bayesian
nonparametric methods for phylodynamics use either change-point models or
Gaussian process priors to recover population size trajectories of unknown
form. Change-point models suffer from computational issues when the number of
change-points is unknown and needs to be estimated. Gaussian process-based
methods lack local adaptivity and cannot accurately recover trajectories that
exhibit features such as abrupt changes in trend or varying levels of
smoothness. We propose a novel, locally-adaptive approach to Bayesian
nonparametric phylodynamic inference that has the flexibility to accommodate a
large class of functional behaviors. Local adaptivity results from modeling the
log-transformed effective population size a priori as a horseshoe Markov random
field, a recently proposed statistical model that blends together the best
properties of the change-point and Gaussian process modeling paradigms. We use
simulated data to assess model performance, and find that our proposed method
results in reduced bias and increased precision when compared to contemporary
methods. We also use our models to reconstruct past changes in genetic
diversity of human hepatitis C virus in Egypt and to estimate population size
changes of ancient and modern steppe bison. These analyses show that our new
method captures features of the population size trajectories that were missed
by the state-of-the-art phylodynamic methods.

"  Social and affective relations may shape empathy to others' affective states.
Previous studies also revealed that people tend to form very different mental
representations of stimuli on the basis of their physical distance. In this
regard, embodied cognition proposes that different physical distances between
individuals activate different interpersonal processing modes, such that close
physical distance tends to activate the interpersonal processing mode typical
of socially and affectively close relationships. In Experiment 1, two groups of
participants were administered a pain decision task involving upright and
inverted face stimuli painfully or neutrally stimulated, and we monitored their
neural empathic reactions by means of event-related potentials (ERPs)
technique. Crucially, participants were presented with face stimuli of one of
two possible sizes in order to manipulate retinal size and perceived physical
distance, roughly corresponding to the close and far portions of social
distance. ERPs modulations compatible with an empathic reaction were observed
only for the group exposed to face stimuli appearing to be at a close social
distance from the participants. This reaction was absent in the group exposed
to smaller stimuli corresponding to face stimuli observed from a far social
distance. In Experiment 2, one different group of participants was engaged in a
match-to-sample task involving the two-size upright face stimuli of Experiment
1 to test whether the modulation of neural empathic reaction observed in
Experiment 1 could be ascribable to differences in the ability to identify
faces of the two different sizes. Results suggested that face stimuli of the
two sizes could be equally identifiable. In line with the Construal Level and
Embodied Simulation theoretical frameworks, we conclude that perceived physical
distance may shape empathy as well as social and affective distance.
"
"  We devise an approach for targeted molecular design, a problem of interest in
computational drug discovery: given a target protein site, we wish to generate
a chemical with both high binding affinity to the target and satisfactory
pharmacological properties. This problem is made difficult by the enormity and
discreteness of the space of potential therapeutics, as well as the
graph-structured nature of biomolecular surface sites. Using a dataset of
protein-ligand complexes, we surmount these issues by extracting a signature of
the target site with a graph convolutional network and by encoding the discrete
chemical into a continuous latent vector space. The latter embedding permits
gradient-based optimization in molecular space, which we perform using learned
differentiable models of binding affinity and other pharmacological properties.
We show that our approach is able to efficiently optimize these multiple
objectives and discover new molecules with potentially useful binding
properties, validated via docking methods.

"  A new detailed mathematical model for dynamics of immune response to
hepatitis B is proposed, which takes into account contributions from innate and
adaptive immune responses, as well as cytokines. Stability analysis of
different steady states is performed to identify parameter regions where the
model exhibits clearance of infection, maintenance of a chronic infection, or
periodic oscillations. Effects of nucleoside analogues and interferon
treatments are analysed, and the critical drug efficiency is determined.
"
"  Neuronal and glial cells release diverse proteoglycans and glycoproteins,
which aggregate in the extracellular space and form the extracellular matrix
(ECM) that may in turn regulate major cellular functions. Brain cells also
release extracellular proteases that may degrade the ECM, and both synthesis
and degradation of ECM are activity-dependent. In this study we introduce a
mathematical model describing population dynamics of neurons interacting with
ECM molecules over extended timescales. It is demonstrated that depending on
the prevalent biophysical mechanism of ECM-neuronal interactions, different
dynamical regimes of ECM activity can be observed, including bistable states
with stable stationary levels of ECM molecule concentration, spontaneous ECM
oscillations, and coexistence of ECM oscillations and a stationary state,
allowing dynamical switches between activity regimes.
"
"  This book chapter introduces to the problem to which extent search strategies
of foraging biological organisms can be identified by statistical data analysis
and mathematical modeling. A famous paradigm in this field is the Levy Flight
Hypothesis: It states that under certain mathematical conditions Levy flights,
which are a key concept in the theory of anomalous stochastic processes,
provide an optimal search strategy. This hypothesis may be understood
biologically as the claim that Levy flights represent an evolutionary adaptive
optimal search strategy for foraging organisms. Another interpretation,
however, is that Levy flights emerge from the interaction between a forager and
a given (scale-free) distribution of food sources. These hypotheses are
discussed controversially in the current literature. We give examples and
counterexamples of experimental data and their analyses supporting and
challenging them.

"  In order to understand the formation of social conventions we need to know
the specific role of control and learning in multi-agent systems. To advance in
this direction, we propose, within the framework of the Distributed Adaptive
Control (DAC) theory, a novel Control-based Reinforcement Learning architecture
(CRL) that can account for the acquisition of social conventions in multi-agent
populations that are solving a benchmark social decision-making problem. Our
new CRL architecture, as a concrete realization of DAC multi-agent theory,
implements a low-level sensorimotor control loop handling the agent's reactive
behaviors (pre-wired reflexes), along with a layer based on model-free
reinforcement learning that maximizes long-term reward. We apply CRL in a
multi-agent game-theoretic task in which coordination must be achieved in order
to find an optimal solution. We show that our CRL architecture is able to both
find optimal solutions in discrete and continuous time and reproduce human
experimental data on standard game-theoretic metrics such as efficiency in
acquiring rewards, fairness in reward distribution and stability of convention
formation.
"
"  Evidence accumulation models of simple decision-making have long assumed that
the brain estimates a scalar decision variable corresponding to the
log-likelihood ratio of the two alternatives. Typical neural implementations of
this algorithmic cognitive model assume that large numbers of neurons are each
noisy exemplars of the scalar decision variable. Here we propose a neural
implementation of the diffusion model in which many neurons construct and
maintain the Laplace transform of the distance to each of the decision bounds.
As in classic findings from brain regions including LIP, the firing rate of
neurons coding for the Laplace transform of net accumulated evidence grows to a
bound during random dot motion tasks. However, rather than noisy exemplars of a
single mean value, this approach makes the novel prediction that firing rates
grow to the bound exponentially, across neurons there should be a distribution
of different rates. A second set of neurons records an approximate inversion of
the Laplace transform, these neurons directly estimate net accumulated
evidence. In analogy to time cells and place cells observed in the hippocampus
and other brain regions, the neurons in this second set have receptive fields
along a ""decision axis."" This finding is consistent with recent findings from
rodent recordings. This theoretical approach places simple evidence
accumulation models in the same mathematical language as recent proposals for
representing time and space in cognitive models for memory.
"
"  The two most fundamental processes describing change in biology -development
and evolution- occur over drastically different timescales, difficult to
reconcile within a unified framework. Development involves a temporal sequence
of cell states controlled by a hierarchy of regulatory structures. It occurs
over the lifetime of a single individual, and is associated to the gene
expression level change of a given genotype. Evolution, by contrast entails
genotypic change through the acquisition or loss of genes, and involves the
emergence of new, environmentally selected phenotypes over the lifetimes of
many individ- uals. Here we present a model of regulatory network evolution
that accounts for both timescales. We extend the framework of boolean models of
gene regulatory network (GRN)-currently only applicable to describing
development-to include evolutionary processes. As opposed to one-to-one maps to
specific attractors, we identify the phenotypes of the cells as the relevant
macrostates of the GRN. A pheno- type may now correspond to multiple
attractors, and its formal definition no longer require a fixed size for the
genotype. This opens the possibility for a quantitative study of the phenotypic
change of a genotype, which is itself changing over evolutionary timescales. We
show how the realization of specific phenotypes can be controlled by gene
duplication events, and how successive events of gene duplication lead to new
regulatory structures via selection. It is these structures that enable control
of macroscale patterning, as in development. The proposed framework therefore
provides a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of regulatory structures
controlling development over evolutionary time.
"
"  Moran or Wright-Fisher processes are probably the most well known model to
study the evolution of a population under various effects. Our object of study
will be the Simpson index which measures the level of diversity of the
population, one of the key parameter for ecologists who study for example
forest dynamics. Following ecological motivations, we will consider here the
case where there are various species with fitness and immigration parameters
being random processes (and thus time evolving). To measure biodiversity,
ecologists generally use the Simpson index, who has no closed formula, except
in the neutral (no selection) case via a backward approach, and which is
difficult to evaluate even numerically when the population size is large. Our
approach relies on the large population limit in the ""weak"" selection case, and
thus to give a procedure which enable us to approximate, with controlled rate,
the expectation of the Simpson index at fixed time. Our approach will be
forward and valid for all time, which is the main difference with the
historical approach of Kingman, or Krone-Neuhauser. We will also study the long
time behaviour of the Wright-Fisher process in a simplified setting, allowing
us to get a full picture for the approximation of the expectation of the
Simpson index.
"
"  A central question in neuroscience is how to develop realistic models that
predict output firing behavior based on provided external stimulus. Given a set
of external inputs and a set of output spike trains, the objective is to
discover a network structure which can accomplish the transformation as
accurately as possible. Due to the difficulty of this problem in its most
general form, approximations have been made in previous work. Past
approximations have sacrificed network size, recurrence, allowed spiked count,
or have imposed layered network structure. Here we present a learning rule
without these sacrifices, which produces a weight matrix of a leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) network to match the output activity of both
deterministic LIF networks as well as probabilistic integrate-and-fire (PIF)
networks. Inspired by synaptic scaling, our pre-synaptic pool modification
(PSPM) algorithm outputs deterministic, fully recurrent spiking neural networks
that can provide a novel generative model for given spike trains. Similarity in
output spike trains is evaluated with a variety of metrics including a
van-Rossum like measure and a numerical comparison of inter-spike interval
distributions. Application of our algorithm to randomly generated networks
improves similarity to the reference spike trains on both of these stated
measures. In addition, we generated LIF networks that operate near criticality
when trained on critical PIF outputs. Our results establish that learning rules
based on synaptic homeostasis can be used to represent input-output
relationships in fully recurrent spiking neural networks.
"
"  The pairwise maximum entropy model, also known as the Ising model, has been
widely used to analyze the collective activity of neurons. However, controversy
persists in the literature about seemingly inconsistent findings, whose
significance is unclear due to lack of reliable error estimates. We therefore
develop a method for accurately estimating parameter uncertainty based on
random walks in parameter space using adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo after
the convergence of the main optimization algorithm. We apply our method to the
spiking patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons recorded with
multielectrode arrays in the human temporal cortex during the wake-sleep cycle.
Our analysis shows that the Ising model captures neuronal collective behavior
much better than the independent model during wakefulness, light sleep, and
deep sleep when both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons are modeled;
ignoring the inhibitory effects of I-neurons dramatically overestimates
synchrony among E-neurons. Furthermore, information-theoretic measures reveal
that the Ising model explains about 80%-95% of the correlations, depending on
sleep state and neuron type. Thermodynamic measures show signatures of
criticality, although we take this with a grain of salt as it may be merely a
reflection of long-range neural correlations.

"  Estimated connectomes by the means of neuroimaging techniques have enriched
our knowledge of the organizational properties of the brain leading to the
development of network-based clinical diagnostics. Unfortunately, to date, many
of those network-based clinical diagnostics tools, based on the mere
description of isolated instances of observed connectomes are noisy estimates
of the true connectivity network. Modeling brain connectivity networks is
therefore important to better explain the functional organization of the brain
and allow inference of specific brain properties. In this report, we present
pilot results on the modeling of combined MEG and fMRI neuroimaging data
acquired during an n-back memory task experiment. We adopted a pooled
Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) as a network statistical model to capture
the underlying process in functional brain networks of 9 subjects MEG and fMRI
data out of 32 during a 0-back vs 2-back memory task experiment. Our results
suggested strong evidence that all the functional connectomes of the 9 subjects
have small world properties. A group level comparison using comparing the
conditions pairwise showed no significant difference in the functional
connectomes across the subjects. Our pooled ERGMs successfully reproduced
important brain properties such as functional segregation and functional
integration. However, the ERGMs reproducing the functional segregation of the
brain networks discriminated between the 0-back and 2-back conditions while the
models reproducing both properties failed to successfully discriminate between
both conditions. Our results are promising and would improve in robustness with
a larger sample size. Nevertheless, our pilot results tend to support previous
findings that functional segregation and integration are sufficient to
statistically reproduce the main properties of brain network.

"  Significant training is required to visually interpret neonatal EEG signals.
This study explores alternative sound-based methods for EEG interpretation
which are designed to allow for intuitive and quick differentiation between
healthy background activity and abnormal activity such as seizures. A novel
method based on frequency and amplitude modulation (FM/AM) is presented. The
algorithm is tuned to facilitate the audio domain perception of rhythmic
activity which is specific to neonatal seizures. The method is compared with
the previously developed phase vocoder algorithm for different time compressing
factors. A survey is conducted amongst a cohort of non-EEG experts to
quantitatively and qualitatively examine the performance of sound-based methods
in comparison with the visual interpretation. It is shown that both
sonification methods perform similarly well, with a smaller inter-observer
variability in comparison with visual. A post-survey analysis of results is
performed by examining the sensitivity of the ear to frequency evolution in
audio.

"  Evolutionary game dynamics in structured populations are strongly affected by
updating rules. Previous studies usually focus on imitation-based rules, which
rely on payoff information of social peers. Recent behavioral experiments
suggest that whether individuals use such social information for strategy
updating may be crucial to the outcomes of social interactions. This hints at
the importance of considering updating rules without dependence on social
peers' payoff information, which, however, is rarely investigated. Here, we
study aspiration-based self-evaluation rules, with which individuals
self-assess the performance of strategies by comparing own payoffs with an
imaginary value they aspire, called the aspiration level. We explore the fate
of strategies on population structures represented by graphs or networks. Under
weak selection, we analytically derive the condition for strategy dominance,
which is found to coincide with the classical condition of risk-dominance. This
condition holds for all networks and all distributions of aspiration levels,
and for individualized ways of self-evaluation. Our condition can be
intuitively interpreted: one strategy prevails over the other if the strategy
brings more satisfaction to individuals than the other does. Our work thus
sheds light on the intrinsic difference between evolutionary dynamics induced
by aspiration-based and imitation-based rules.

"  Distributions of anthropogenic signatures (impacts and activities) are
mathematically analysed. The aim is to understand the Anthropocene and to see
whether anthropogenic signatures could be used to determine its beginning. A
total of 23 signatures were analysed and results are presented in 31 diagrams.
Some of these signatures contain undistinguishable natural components but most
of them are of purely anthropogenic origin. Great care was taken to identify
abrupt accelerations, which could be used to determine the beginning of the
Anthropocene. Results of the analysis can be summarised in three conclusions.
1. Anthropogenic signatures cannot be used to determine the beginning of the
Anthropocene. 2. There was no abrupt Great Acceleration around 1950 or around
any other time. 3. Anthropogenic signatures are characterised by the Great
Deceleration in the second half of the 20th century. The second half of the
20th century does not mark the beginning of the Anthropocene but most likely
the beginning of the end of the strong anthropogenic impacts, maybe even the
beginning of a transition to a sustainable future. The Anthropocene is a unique
stage in human experience but it has no clearly marked beginning and it is
probably not a new geological epoch.

"  Humans can easily describe, imagine, and, crucially, predict a wide variety
of behaviors of liquids--splashing, squirting, gushing, sloshing, soaking,
dripping, draining, trickling, pooling, and pouring--despite tremendous
variability in their material and dynamical properties. Here we propose and
test a computational model of how people perceive and predict these liquid
dynamics, based on coarse approximate simulations of fluids as collections of
interacting particles. Our model is analogous to a ""game engine in the head"",
drawing on techniques for interactive simulations (as in video games) that
optimize for efficiency and natural appearance rather than physical accuracy.
In two behavioral experiments, we found that the model accurately captured
people's predictions about how liquids flow among complex solid obstacles, and
was significantly better than two alternatives based on simple heuristics and
deep neural networks. Our model was also able to explain how people's
predictions varied as a function of the liquids' properties (e.g., viscosity
and stickiness). Together, the model and empirical results extend the recent
proposal that human physical scene understanding for the dynamics of rigid,
solid objects can be supported by approximate probabilistic simulation, to the
more complex and unexplored domain of fluid dynamics.

"  What can we learn from a connectome? We constructed a simplified model of the
first two stages of the fly visual system, the lamina and medulla. The
resulting hexagonal lattice convolutional network was trained using
backpropagation through time to perform object tracking in natural scene
videos. Networks initialized with weights from connectome reconstructions
automatically discovered well-known orientation and direction selectivity
properties in T4 neurons and their inputs, while networks initialized at random
did not. Our work is the first demonstration, that knowledge of the connectome
can enable in silico predictions of the functional properties of individual
neurons in a circuit, leading to an understanding of circuit function from
structure alone.

"  The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is a threshold parameter for disease
extinction or survival in isolated populations. However no human population is
fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental
models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number for populations
with local person-to-person transmission and exposure from some other source:
either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a
reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become
extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported
cases (since $R_0<1$), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that
many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show
that in the simplest case, $R_0<1$ if and only if the proportion of infections
acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore
how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect
this rule. We apply these rules in two cases studies of Clostridium difficile
infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for
imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for
exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted,
highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction
number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was
sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue
that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0%
of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.

"  This article is dedicated to the late Giorgio Israel. R{é}sum{é}. The aim
of this article is to propose on the one hand a brief history of modeling
starting from the works of Fibonacci, Robert Malthus, Pierre Francis Verhulst
and then Vito Volterra and, on the other hand, to present the main hypotheses
of the very famous but very little known predator-prey model elaborated in the
1920s by Volterra in order to solve a problem posed by his son-in-law, Umberto
D'Ancona. It is thus shown that, contrary to a widely-held notion, Volterra's
model is realistic and his seminal work laid the groundwork for modern
population dynamics and mathematical ecology, including seasonality, migration,
pollution and more. 1. A short history of modeling 1.1. The Malthusian model.
If the rst scientic view of population growth seems to be that of Leonardo
Fibonacci [2], also called Leonardo of Pisa, whose famous sequence of numbers
was presented in his Liber abaci (1202) as a solution to a population growth
problem, the modern foundations of population dynamics clearly date from Thomas
Robert Malthus [20]. Considering an ideal population consisting of a single
homogeneous animal species, that is, neglecting the variations in age, size and
any periodicity for birth or mortality, and which lives alone in an invariable
environment or coexists with other species without any direct or indirect
inuence, he founded in 1798, with his celebrated claim Population, when
unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio, the paradigm of exponential
growth. This consists in assuming that the increase of the number N (t) of
individuals of this population, during a short interval of time, is
proportional to N (t). This translates to the following dierential equation :
(1) dN (t) dt = $\epsilon$N (t) where $\epsilon$ is a constant factor of
proportionality that represents the growth coe-cient or growth rate. By
integrating (1) we obtain the law of exponential growth or law of Malthusian
growth (see Fig. 1). This law, which does not take into account the limits
imposed by the environment on growth and which is in disagreement with the
actual facts, had a profound inuence on Charles Darwin's work on natural
selection. Indeed, Darwin [1] founded the idea of survival of the ttest on the

population kinetics, since the interaction between species cannot be
represented by forces. 2. A population is dened as the set of individuals of
the same species living on the same territory and able to reproduce among
themselves.

"  Protein pattern formation is essential for the spatial organization of many
intracellular processes like cell division, flagellum positioning, and
chemotaxis. A prominent example of intracellular patterns are the oscillatory
pole-to-pole oscillations of Min proteins in \textit{E. coli} whose biological
function is to ensure precise cell division. Cell polarization, a prerequisite
for processes such as stem cell differentiation and cell polarity in yeast, is
also mediated by a diffusion-reaction process. More generally, these functional
modules of cells serve as model systems for self-organization, one of the core
principles of life. Under which conditions spatio-temporal patterns emerge, and
how these patterns are regulated by biochemical and geometrical factors are
major aspects of current research. Here we review recent theoretical and
experimental advances in the field of intracellular pattern formation, focusing
on general design principles and fundamental physical mechanisms.

"  The ability to locally degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interact
with the tumour microenvironment is a key process distinguishing cancer from
normal cells, and is a critical step in the metastatic spread of the tumour.
The invasion of the surrounding tissue involves the coordinated action between
cancer cells, the ECM, the matrix degrading enzymes, and the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This is a regulatory process
through which epithelial cells (ECs) acquire mesenchymal characteristics and
transform to mesenchymal-like cells (MCs). In this paper, we present a new
mathematical model which describes the transition from a collective invasion
strategy for the ECs to an individual invasion strategy for the MCs. We achieve
this by formulating a coupled hybrid system consisting of partial and
stochastic differential equations that describe the evolution of the ECs and
the MCs, respectively. This approach allows one to reproduce in a very natural
way fundamental qualitative features of the current biomedical understanding of
cancer invasion that are not easily captured by classical modelling approaches,
for example, the invasion of the ECM by self-generated gradients and the
appearance of EC invasion islands outside of the main body of the tumour.

"  We examine salient trends of influenza pandemics in Australia, a rapidly
urbanizing nation. To do so, we implement state-of-the-art influenza
transmission and progression models within a large-scale stochastic computer
simulation, generated using comprehensive Australian census datasets from 2006,
2011, and 2016. Our results offer the first simulation-based investigation of a
population's sensitivity to pandemics across multiple historical time points,
and highlight three significant trends in pandemic patterns over the years:
increased peak prevalence, faster spreading rates, and decreasing
spatiotemporal bimodality. We attribute these pandemic trends to increases in
two key quantities indicative of urbanization: population fraction residing in
major cities, and international air traffic. In addition, we identify features
of the pandemic's geographic spread that can only be attributed to changes in
the commuter mobility network. The generic nature of our model and the ubiquity
of urbanization trends around the world make it likely for our results to be
applicable in other rapidly urbanizing nations.

"  Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a prominent theory of consciousness
that has at its centre measures that quantify the extent to which a system
generates more information than the sum of its parts. While several candidate
measures of integrated information (`$\Phi$') now exist, little is known about
how they compare, especially in terms of their behaviour on non-trivial network
models. In this article we provide clear and intuitive descriptions of six
distinct candidate measures. We then explore the properties of each of these
measures in simulation on networks consisting of eight interacting nodes,
animated with Gaussian linear autoregressive dynamics. We find a striking
diversity in the behaviour of these measures -- no two measures show consistent
agreement across all analyses. Further, only a subset of the measures appear to
genuinely reflect some form of dynamical complexity, in the sense of
simultaneous segregation and integration between system components. Our results
help guide the operationalisation of IIT and advance the development of
measures of integrated information that may have more general applicability.

"  This is an epidemiological SIRV model based study that is designed to analyze
the impact of vaccination in containing infection spread, in a 4-tiered
population compartment comprised of susceptible, infected, recovered and
vaccinated agents. While many models assume a lifelong protection through
vaccination, we focus on the impact of waning immunization due to conversion of
vaccinated and recovered agents back to susceptible ones. Two asymptotic states
exist, the ""disease-free equilibrium"" and the ""endemic equilibrium""; we express
the transitions between these states as function of the vaccination and
conversion rates using the basic reproduction number as a descriptor. We find
that the vaccination of newborns and adults have different consequences in
controlling epidemics. We also find that a decaying disease protection within
the recovered sub-population is not sufficient to trigger an epidemic at the
linear level. Our simulations focus on parameter sets that could model a
disease with waning immunization like pertussis. For a diffusively coupled
population, a transition to the endemic state can be initiated via the
propagation of a traveling infection wave, described successfully within a
Fisher-Kolmogorov framework.

"  Clinically-relevant forms of acute cell injury, which include stroke and
myocardial infarction, have been of long-lasting challenge in terms of
successful intervention and treatments. Although laboratory studies have shown
it is possible to decrease cell death after such injuries, human clinical
trials based on laboratory therapies have generally failed. We suggested these
failures are due, at least partially, to the lack of a quantitative theoretical
framework for acute cell injury. Here we provide a systematic study on a
nonlinear dynamical model of acute cell injury and characterize the global
dynamics of a nonautonomous version of the theory. The nonautonomous model
gives rise to four qualitative types of dynamical patterns that can be mapped
to the behavior of cells after clinical acute injuries. In addition, the
concept of a maximum total intrinsic stress response, $S_{max}^*$, emerges from
the nonautonomous theory. A continuous transition across the four qualitative
patterns has been observed, which sets a natural range for initial conditions.
Under these initial conditions in the parameter space tested, the total induced
stress response can be increased to 2.5-11 folds of $S_{max}^*$. This result
indicates that cells possess a reserve stress response capacity which provides
a theoretical explanation of how therapies can prevent cell death after lethal
injuries. This nonautonomous theory of acute cell injury thus provides a
quantitative framework for understanding cell death and recovery and developing
effective therapeutics for acute injury.

"  Variational auto-encoder frameworks have demonstrated success in reducing
complex nonlinear dynamics in molecular simulation to a single non-linear
embedding. In this work, we illustrate how this non-linear latent embedding can
be used as a collective variable for enhanced sampling, and present a simple
modification that allows us to rapidly perform sampling in multiple related
systems. We first demonstrate our method is able to describe the effects of
force field changes in capped alanine dipeptide after learning a model using
AMBER99. We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders
that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger
systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure
based independent component analysis (tICA). Using this technique, we show how
such a model trained for one protein, the WW domain, can efficiently be
transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the GTT
mutation. This method shows promise for its ability to rapidly sample related
systems using a single transferable collective variable and is generally
applicable to sets of related simulations, enabling us to probe the effects of
variation in increasingly large systems of biophysical interest.
"
"  DNA Methylation has been the most extensively studied epigenetic mark.
Usually a change in the genotype, DNA sequence, leads to a change in the
phenotype, observable characteristics of the individual. But DNA methylation,
which happens in the context of CpG (cytosine and guanine bases linked by
phosphate backbone) dinucleotides, does not lead to a change in the original
DNA sequence but has the potential to change the phenotype. DNA methylation is
implicated in various biological processes and diseases including cancer. Hence
there is a strong interest in understanding the DNA methylation patterns across
various epigenetic related ailments in order to distinguish and diagnose the
type of disease in its early stages. In this work, the relationship between
methylated versus unmethylated CpG regions and cancer types is explored using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A CNN based Deep Learning model that can
classify the cancer of a new DNA methylation profile based on the learning from
publicly available DNA methylation datasets is then proposed.

"  Axon guidance is a crucial process for growth of the central and peripheral
nervous systems. In this study, 3 axon guidance related disorders, namely-
Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS) , Horizontal Gaze Palsy with Progressive
Scoliosis (HGPPS) and Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3
(CFEOM3) were studied using various Systems Biology tools to identify the genes
and proteins involved with them to get a better idea about the underlying
molecular mechanisms including the regulatory mechanisms. Based on the analyses
carried out, 7 significant modules have been identified from the PPI network.
Five pathways/processes have been found to be significantly associated with
DRS, HGPPS and CFEOM3 associated genes. From the PPI network, 3 have been
identified as hub proteins- DRD2, UBC and CUL3.

"  Here I introduce an extension to demixed principal component analysis (dPCA),
a linear dimensionality reduction technique for analyzing the activity of
neural populations, to the case of nonlinear dimensions. This is accomplished
using kernel methods, resulting in kernel demixed principal component analysis
(kdPCA). This extension resembles kernel-based extensions to standard principal
component analysis and canonical correlation analysis. kdPCA includes dPCA as a
special case when the kernel is linear. I present examples of simulated neural
activity that follows different low dimensional configurations and compare the
results of kdPCA to dPCA. These simulations demonstrate that nonlinear
interactions can impede the ability of dPCA to demix neural activity
corresponding to experimental parameters, but kdPCA can still recover
interpretable components. Additionally, I compare kdPCA and dPCA to a neural
population from rat orbitofrontal cortex during an odor classification task in
recovering decision-related activity.
"
"  Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and
transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred
to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms
that together contribute to the development and specialization of our
sensorimotor skills as well as to the long-term memory consolidation and
retrieval without catastrophic forgetting. Consequently, lifelong learning
capabilities are crucial for autonomous agents interacting in the real world
and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning
remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network
models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information
from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic
forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for
state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn
representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without
accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available
over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked
to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing
neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic
forgetting. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by
lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity,
memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and
multisensory integration.

"  Gene expression (GE) data capture valuable condition-specific information
(""condition"" can mean a biological process, disease stage, age, patient, etc.)
However, GE analyses ignore physical interactions between gene products, i.e.,
proteins. Since proteins function by interacting with each other, and since
biological networks (BNs) capture these interactions, BN analyses are
promising. However, current BN data fail to capture condition-specific
information. Recently, GE and BN data have been integrated using network
propagation (NP) to infer condition-specific BNs. However, existing NP-based
studies result in a static condition-specific network, even though cellular
processes are dynamic. A dynamic process of our interest is aging. We use
prominent existing NP methods in a new task of inferring a dynamic rather than
static condition-specific (aging-related) network. Then, we study evolution of
network structure with age - we identify proteins whose network positions
significantly change with age and predict them as new aging-related candidates.
We validate the predictions via e.g., functional enrichment analyses and
literature search. Dynamic network inference via NP yields higher prediction
quality than the only existing method for inferring a dynamic aging-related BN,
which does not use NP.
"
"  Machine learning-guided protein engineering is a new paradigm that enables
the optimization of complex protein functions. Machine-learning methods use
data to predict protein function without requiring a detailed model of the
underlying physics or biological pathways. They accelerate protein engineering
by learning from information contained in all measured variants and using it to
select variants that are likely to be improved. In this review, we introduce
the steps required to collect protein data, train machine-learning models, and
use trained models to guide engineering. We make recommendations at each stage
and look to future opportunities for machine learning to enable the discovery
of new protein functions and uncover the relationship between protein sequence
and function.
"
"  Although Darwinian models are rampant in the social sciences, social
scientists do not face the problem that motivated Darwin's theory of natural
selection: the problem of explaining how lineages evolve despite that any
traits they acquire are regularly discarded at the end of the lifetime of the
individuals that acquired them. While the rationale for framing culture as an
evolutionary process is correct, it does not follow that culture is a Darwinian
or selectionist process, or that population genetics and phylogenetics provide
viable starting points for modeling cultural change. This paper lays out
step-by-step arguments as to why this approach is ill-conceived, focusing on
the lack of randomness and lack of a self-assembly code in cultural evolution,
and summarizes an alternative approach.
"
"  The comparison of observed brain activity with the statistics generated by
artificial intelligence systems is useful to probe brain functional
organization under ecological conditions. Here we study fMRI activity in ten
subjects watching color natural movies and compute deep representations of
these movies with an architecture that relies on optical flow and image
content. The association of activity in visual areas with the different layers
of the deep architecture displays complexity-related contrasts across visual
areas and reveals a striking foveal/peripheral dichotomy.
"
"  Understanding cell identity is an important task in many biomedical areas.
Expression patterns of specific marker genes have been used to characterize
some limited cell types, but exclusive markers are not available for many cell
types. A second approach is to use machine learning to discriminate cell types
based on the whole gene expression profiles (GEPs). The accuracies of simple
classification algorithms such as linear discriminators or support vector
machines are limited due to the complexity of biological systems. We used deep
neural networks to analyze 1040 GEPs from 16 different human tissues and cell
types. After comparing different architectures, we identified a specific
structure of deep autoencoders that can encode a GEP into a vector of 30
numeric values, which we call the cell identity code (CIC). The original GEP
can be reproduced from the CIC with an accuracy comparable to technical
replicates of the same experiment. Although we use an unsupervised approach to
train the autoencoder, we show different values of the CIC are connected to
different biological aspects of the cell, such as different pathways or
biological processes. This network can use CIC to reproduce the GEP of the cell
types it has never seen during the training. It also can resist some noise in
the measurement of the GEP. Furthermore, we introduce classifier autoencoder,
an architecture that can accurately identify cell type based on the GEP or the
CIC.
"
"  Experiments and simulations have established that dynamics in a class of
living and abiotic systems that are far from equilibrium exhibit super
diffusive behavior at long times, which in some cases (for example evolving
tumor) is preceded by slow glass-like dynamics. By using the evolution of a
collection of tumor cells, driven by mechanical forces and subject to cell
birth and apoptosis, as a case study we show theoretically that on short time
scales the mean square displacement is sub-diffusive due to jamming, whereas at
long times it is super diffusive. The results obtained using stochastic
quantization method, which is needed because of the absence of
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), show that the super-diffusive behavior
is universal and impervious to the nature of cell-cell interactions.
Surprisingly, the theory also quantitatively accounts for the non-trivial
dynamics observed in simulations of a model soap foam characterized by creation
and destruction of spherical bubbles, which suggests that the two
non-equilibrium systems belong to the same universality class. The theoretical
prediction for the super diffusion exponent is in excellent agreement with
simulations for collective motion of tumor cells and dynamics associated with
soap bubbles.

"  Colletotrichum represent a genus of fungal species primarily known as plant
pathogens with severe economic impacts in temperate, subtropical and tropical
climates Consensus taxonomy and classification systems for Colletotrichum
species have been undergoing revision as high resolution genomic data becomes
available. Here we propose an alternative annotation that provides a complete
sequence for a Colletotrichum YPT1 gene homolog using the whole genome shotgun
sequence of Colletotrichum incanum isolated from soybean crops in Illinois,
USA.
"
"  The ideas that we forge creatively as individuals and groups build on one
another in a manner that is cumulative and adaptive, forming open-ended
lineages across space and time. Thus, human culture is believed to evolve. The
pervasiveness of cross-domain creativity--as when a song inspires a
painting--would appear indicative of discontinuities in cultural lineages.
However, if what evolves through culture is our worldviews--the webs of
thoughts, ideas, and attitudes that constitutes our way of seeing being in the
world--then the problem of discontinuities is solved. The state of a worldview
can be affected by information assimilated in one domain, and this
change-of-state can be expressed in another domain. In this view, the gesture,
narrative, or artifact that constitutes a specific creative act is not what is
evolving; it is merely the external manifestation of the state of an evolving
worldview. Like any evolutionary process, cultural evolution requires a balance
between novelty, via the generation of variation, and continuity, via the
preservation of variants that are adaptive. In cultural evolution, novelty is
generated through creativity, and continuity is provided by social learning
processes, e.g., imitation. Both the generative and imitative aspects of
cultural evolution are affected by social media. We discuss the trajectory from
social ideation to social innovation, focusing on the role of
self-organization, renewal, and perspective-taking at the individual and social
group level.
"
"  Decision making based on behavioral and neural observations of living systems
has been extensively studied in brain science, psychology, and other
disciplines. Decision-making mechanisms have also been experimentally
implemented in physical processes, such as single photons and chaotic lasers.
The findings of these experiments suggest that there is a certain common basis
in describing decision making, regardless of its physical realizations. In this
study, we propose a local reservoir model to account for choice-based learning
(CBL). CBL describes decision consistency as a phenomenon where making a
certain decision increases the possibility of making that same decision again
later, which has been intensively investigated in neuroscience, psychology,
etc. Our proposed model is inspired by the viewpoint that a decision is
affected by its local environment, which is referred to as a local reservoir.
If the size of the local reservoir is large enough, consecutive decision making
will not be affected by previous decisions, thus showing lower degrees of
decision consistency in CBL. In contrast, if the size of the local reservoir
decreases, a biased distribution occurs within it, which leads to higher
degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In this study, an analytical approach
on local reservoirs is presented, as well as several numerical demonstrations.
Furthermore, a physical architecture for CBL based on single photons is
discussed, and the effects of local reservoirs is numerically demonstrated.
Decision consistency in human decision-making tasks and in recruiting empirical
data are evaluated based on local reservoir. In summary, the proposed local
reservoir model paves a path toward establishing a foundation for computational
mechanisms and the systematic analysis of decision making on different levels.

"  Current methods to optimize vaccine dose are purely empirically based,
whereas in the drug development field, dosing determinations use far more
advanced quantitative methodology to accelerate decision-making. Applying these
established methods in the field of vaccine development may reduce the
currently large clinical trial sample sizes, long time frames, high costs, and
ultimately have a better potential to save lives. We propose the field of
immunostimulation/immunodynamic (IS/ID) modelling, which aims to translate
mathematical frameworks used for drug dosing towards optimizing vaccine dose
decision-making. Analogous to PK/PD modelling, IS/ID modelling approaches apply
mathematical models to describe the underlying mechanisms by which the immune
response is stimulated by vaccination (IS) and the resulting measured immune
response dynamics (ID). To move IS/ID modelling forward, existing datasets and
further data on vaccine allometry and dose-dependent dynamics need to be
generated and collate, requiring a collaborative environment with input from
academia, industry, regulators, governmental and non-governmental agencies to
share modelling expertise, and connect modellers to vaccine data.
"
"  Many neural systems display avalanche behavior characterized by uninterrupted
sequences of neuronal firing whose distributions of size and durations are
heavy-tailed. Theoretical models of such systems suggest that these dynamics
support optimal information transmission and storage. However, the unknown role
of network structure precludes an understanding of how variations in network
topology manifest in neural dynamics and either support or impinge upon
information processing. Here, using a generalized spiking model, we develop a
mechanistic understanding of how network topology supports information
processing through network dynamics. First, we show how network topology
determines network dynamics by analytically and numerically demonstrating that
network topology can be designed to propagate stimulus patterns for long
durations. We then identify strongly connected cycles as empirically observable
network motifs that are prevalent in such networks. Next, we show that within a
network, mathematical intuitions from network control theory are tightly linked
with dynamics initiated by node-specific stimulation and can identify stimuli
that promote long-lasting cascades. Finally, we use these network-based metrics
and control-based stimuli to demonstrate that long-lasting cascade dynamics
facilitate delayed recovery of stimulus patterns from network activity, as
measured by mutual information. Collectively, our results provide evidence that
cortical networks are structured with architectural motifs that support
long-lasting propagation and recovery of a few crucial patterns of stimulation,
especially those consisting of activity in highly controllable neurons.
Broadly, our results imply that avalanching neural networks could contribute to
cognitive faculties that require persistent activation of neuronal patterns,
such as working memory or attention.

"  Chemotherapeutic response of cancer cells to a given compound is one of the
most fundamental information one requires to design anti-cancer drugs. Recent
advances in producing large drug screens against cancer cell lines provided an
opportunity to apply machine learning methods for this purpose. In addition to
cytotoxicity databases, considerable amount of drug-induced gene expression
data has also become publicly available. Following this, several methods that
exploit omics data were proposed to predict drug activity on cancer cells.
However, due to the complexity of cancer drug mechanisms, none of the existing
methods are perfect. One possible direction, therefore, is to combine the
strengths of both the methods and the databases for improved performance. We
demonstrate that integrating a large number of predictions by the proposed
method improves the performance for this task. The predictors in the ensemble
differ in several aspects such as the method itself, the number of tasks method
considers (multi-task vs. single-task) and the subset of data considered
(sub-sampling). We show that all these different aspects contribute to the
success of the final ensemble. In addition, we attempt to use the drug screen
data together with two novel signatures produced from the drug-induced gene
expression profiles of cancer cell lines. Finally, we evaluate the method
predictions by in vitro experiments in addition to the tests on data sets.The
predictions of the methods, the signatures and the software are available from

"  Brain Electroencephalography (EEG) classification is widely applied to
analyze cerebral diseases in recent years. Unfortunately, invalid/noisy EEGs
degrade the diagnosis performance and most previously developed methods ignore
the necessity of EEG selection for classification. To this end, this paper
proposes a novel maximum weight clique-based EEG selection approach, named
mwcEEGs, to map EEG selection to searching maximum similarity-weighted cliques
from an improved Fréchet distance-weighted undirected EEG graph
simultaneously considering edge weights and vertex weights. Our mwcEEGs
improves the classification performance by selecting intra-clique pairwise
similar and inter-clique discriminative EEGs with similarity threshold
$\delta$. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm effectiveness compared
with the state-of-the-art time series selection algorithms on real-world EEG
datasets.

"  The artificial axon is a recently introduced synthetic assembly of supported
lipid bilayers and voltage gated ion channels, displaying the basic
electrophysiology of nerve cells. Here we demonstrate the use of two artificial
axons as control elements to achieve a simple task. Namely, we steer a remote
control car towards a light source, using the sensory input dependent firing
rate of the axons as the control signal for turning left or right. We present
the result in the form of the analysis of a movie of the car approaching the
light source. In general terms, with this work we pursue a constructivist
approach to exploring the nexus between machine language at the nerve cell
level and behavior.

"  Previous experiments have found mixed results on whether honesty is intuitive
or requires deliberation. Here we add to this literature by building on prior
work of Capraro (2017). We report a large study (N=1,389) manipulating time
pressure vs time delay in a deception game. We find that, in this setting,
people are more honest under time pressure, and that this result is not driven
by confounds present in earlier work.

"  Estimating the human longevity and computing of life expectancy are central

"  Antibodies are a critical part of the immune system, having the function of
directly neutralising or tagging undesirable objects (the antigens) for future
destruction. Being able to predict which amino acids belong to the paratope,
the region on the antibody which binds to the antigen, can facilitate antibody
design and contribute to the development of personalised medicine. The
suitability of deep neural networks has recently been confirmed for this task,
with Parapred outperforming all prior physical models. Our contribution is
twofold: first, we significantly outperform the computational efficiency of
Parapred by leveraging à trous convolutions and self-attention. Secondly, we
implement cross-modal attention by allowing the antibody residues to attend
over antigen residues. This leads to new state-of-the-art results on this task,
along with insightful interpretations.

"  The study of brain networks, including derived from functional neuroimaging
data, attracts broad interest and represents a rapidly growing
interdisciplinary field. Comparing networks of healthy volunteers with those of
patients can potentially offer new, quantitative diagnostic methods, and a
framework for better understanding brain and mind disorders. We explore resting
state fMRI data through network measures, and demonstrate that not only is
there a distinctive network architecture in the healthy brain that is disrupted
in schizophrenia, but also that both networks respond to medication. We
construct networks representing 15 healthy individuals and 12 schizophrenia
patients (males and females), all of whom are administered three drug
treatments: (i) a placebo; and two antipsychotic medications (ii) aripiprazole
and; (iii) sulpiride. We first reproduce the established finding that brain
networks of schizophrenia patients exhibit increased efficiency and reduced
clustering compared to controls. Our data then reveals that the antipsychotic
medications mitigate this effect, shifting the metrics towards those observed
in healthy volunteers, with a marked difference in efficacy between the two
drugs. Additionally, we find that aripiprazole considerably alters the network
statistics of healthy controls. Using a test of cognitive ability, we establish
that aripiprazole also adversely affects their performance. This provides
evidence that changes to macroscopic brain network architecture result in
measurable behavioural differences. This is the first time different
medications have been assessed in this way. Our results lay the groundwork for
an objective methodology with which to calculate and compare the efficacy of
different treatments of mind and brain disorders.

"  We propose the $S$-leaping algorithm for the acceleration of Gillespie's
stochastic simulation algorithm that combines the advantages of the two main
accelerated methods; the $\tau$-leaping and $R$-leaping algorithms. These
algorithms are known to be efficient under different conditions; the
$\tau$-leaping is efficient for non-stiff systems or systems with partial
equilibrium, while the $R$-leaping performs better in stiff system thanks to an
efficient sampling procedure. However, even a small change in a system's set up
can critically affect the nature of the simulated system and thus reduce the
efficiency of an accelerated algorithm. The proposed algorithm combines the
efficient time step selection from the $\tau$-leaping with the effective
sampling procedure from the $R$-leaping algorithm. The $S$-leaping is shown to
maintain its efficiency under different conditions and in the case of large and
stiff systems or systems with fast dynamics, the $S$-leaping outperforms both
methods. We demonstrate the performance and the accuracy of the $S$-leaping in
comparison with the $\tau$-leaping and $R$-leaping on a number of benchmark
systems involving biological reaction networks.
"
"  A model of incentive salience as a function of stimulus value and
interoceptive state has been previously proposed. In that model, the function
differs depending on whether the stimulus is appetitive or aversive; it is
multiplicative for appetitive stimuli and additive for aversive stimuli. The
authors argued it was necessary to capture data on how extreme changes in salt
appetite could move evaluation of an extreme salt solution from negative to
positive. We demonstrate that arbitrarily varying this function is unnecessary,
and that a multiplicative function is sufficient if one assumes the incentive
salience function for an incentive (such as salt) is comprised of multiple
stimulus features and multiple interoceptive signals. We show that it is also
unnecessary considering the dual-structure approach-aversive nature of the
reward system, which results in separate weighting of appetitive and aversive
stimulus features.
"
"  In this paper, the parameter estimation problem for a multi-timescale
adaptive threshold (MAT) neuronal model is investigated. By manipulating the
system dynamics, which comprise of a non-resetting leaky integrator coupled
with an adaptive threshold, the threshold voltage can be obtained as a
realizable model that is linear in the unknown parameters. This linearly
parametrized realizable model is then utilized inside a prediction error based
framework to identify the threshold parameters with the purpose of predicting
single neuron precise firing times. The iterative linear least squares
estimation scheme is evaluated using both synthetic data obtained from an exact
model as well as experimental data obtained from in vitro rat somatosensory
cortical neurons. Results show the ability of this approach to fit the MAT
model to different types of fluctuating reference data. The performance of the
proposed approach is seen to be superior when comparing with existing
identification approaches used by the neuronal community.
"
"  In this chapter, we introduce digital holographic microscopy (DHM) as a
marker-free method to determine the refractive index of single, spherical cells
in suspension. The refractive index is a conclusive measure in a biological
context. Cell conditions, such as differentiation or infection, are known to
yield significant changes in the refractive index. Furthermore, the refractive
index of biological tissue determines the way it interacts with light. Besides
the biological relevance of this interaction in the retina, a lot of methods
used in biology, including microscopy, rely on light-tissue or light-cell
interactions. Hence, determining the refractive index of cells using DHM is
valuable in many biological applications. This chapter covers the main topics
which are important for the implementation of DHM: setup, sample preparation
and analysis. First, the optical setup is described in detail including notes
and suggestions for the implementation. Following that, a protocol for the
sample and measurement preparation is explained. In the analysis section, an
algorithm for the determination of the quantitative phase map is described.
Subsequently, all intermediate steps for the calculation of the refractive
index of suspended cells are presented, exploiting their spherical shape. In
the last section, a discussion of possible extensions to the setup, further
measurement configurations and additional analysis methods are given.
Throughout this chapter, we describe a simple, robust, and thus easily
reproducible implementation of DHM. The different possibilities for extensions
show the diverse fields of application for this technique.

"  Interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be complicated by
obfuscating artifacts. Artifact detection plays an important role in the
observation and analysis of EEG signals. Spatial information contained in the
placement of the electrodes can be exploited to accurately detect artifacts.
However, when fewer electrodes are used, less spatial information is available,
making it harder to detect artifacts. In this study, we investigate the
performance of a deep learning algorithm, CNN-LSTM, on several channel
configurations. Each configuration was designed to minimize the amount of
spatial information lost compared to a standard 22-channel EEG. Systems using a
reduced number of channels ranging from 8 to 20 achieved sensitivities between
33% and 37% with false alarms in the range of [38, 50] per 24 hours. False
alarms increased dramatically (e.g., over 300 per 24 hours) when the number of
channels was further reduced. Baseline performance of a system that used all 22
channels was 39% sensitivity with 23 false alarms. Since the 22-channel system
was the only system that included referential channels, the rapid increase in
the false alarm rate as the number of channels was reduced underscores the
importance of retaining referential channels for artifact reduction. This
cautionary result is important because one of the biggest differences between
various types of EEGs administered is the type of referential channel used.
"
"  We present two related methods for deriving connectivity-based brain atlases
from individual connectomes. The proposed methods exploit a previously proposed
dense connectivity representation, termed continuous connectivity, by first
performing graph-based hierarchical clustering of individual brains, and
subsequently aggregating the individual parcellations into a consensus
parcellation. The search for consensus minimizes the sum of cluster membership
distances, effectively estimating a pseudo-Karcher mean of individual
parcellations. We assess the quality of our parcellations using (1)
Kullback-Liebler and Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the dense
connectome representation, (2) inter-hemispheric symmetry, and (3) performance
of the simplified connectome in a biological sex classification task. We find
that the parcellation based-atlas computed using a greedy search at a
hierarchical depth 3 outperforms all other parcellation-based atlases as well
as the standard Dessikan-Killiany anatomical atlas in all three assessments.
"
"  The mechanical properties of the cell depend crucially on the tension of its
cytoskeleton, a biopolymer network that is put under stress by active motor
proteins. While the fibrous nature of the network is known to strongly affect
the transmission of these forces to the cellular scale, our understanding of
this process remains incomplete. Here we investigate the transmission of forces
through the network at the individual filament level, and show that active
forces can be geometrically amplified as a transverse motor-generated force
force ""plucks"" the fiber and induces a nonlinear tension. In stiff and densely
connnected networks, this tension results in large network-wide tensile
stresses that far exceed the expectation drawn from a linear elastic theory.
This amplification mechanism competes with a recently characterized
network-level amplification due to fiber buckling, suggesting that that fiber
networks provide several distinct pathways for living systems to amplify their
molecular forces.
"
"  The stability of sequence replication was crucial for the emergence of
molecular evolution and early life. Exponential replication with a first-order
growth dynamics show inherent instabilities such as the error catastrophe and
the dominance by the fastest replicators. This favors less structured and short
sequences. The theoretical concept of hypercycles has been proposed to solve
these problems. Their higher-order growth kinetics leads to frequency-dependent
selection and stabilizes the replication of majority molecules. However, many
implementations of hypercycles are unstable or require special sequences with
catalytic activity. Here, we demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of
higher-order cooperative replication from a network of simple ligation chain
reactions (LCR). We performed long-term LCR experiments from a mixture of
sequences under molecule degrading conditions with a ligase protein. At the
chosen temperature cycling, a network of positive feedback loops arose from
both the cooperative ligation of matching sequences and the emerging increase
in sequence length. It generated higher-order replication with
frequency-dependent selection. The experiments matched a complete simulation
using experimentally determined ligation rates and the hypercycle mechanism was
also confirmed by abstracted modeling. Since templated ligation is a most basic
reaction of oligonucleotides, the described mechanism could have been
implemented under microthermal convection on early Earth.
"
"  In a language corpus, the probability that a word occurs $n$ times is often
proportional to $1/n^2$. Assigning rank, $s$, to words according to their
abundance, $\log s$ vs $\log n$ typically has a slope of minus one. That simple
Zipf's law pattern also arises in the population sizes of cities, the sizes of
corporations, and other patterns of abundance. By contrast, for the abundances
of different biological species, the probability of a population of size $n$ is
typically proportional to $1/n$, declining exponentially for larger $n$, the
log series pattern. This article shows that the differing patterns of Zipf's
law and the log series arise as the opposing endpoints of a more general
theory. The general theory follows from the generic form of all probability
patterns as a consequence of conserved average values and the associated
invariances of scale. To understand the common patterns of abundance, the
generic form of probability distributions plus the conserved average abundance
is sufficient. The general theory includes cases that are between the Zipf and
log series endpoints, providing a broad framework for analyzing widely observed
abundance patterns.
"
"  Gene regulatory networks play a crucial role in controlling an organism's
biological processes, which is why there is significant interest in developing
computational methods that are able to extract their structure from
high-throughput genetic data. A typical approach consists of a series of
conditional independence tests on the covariance structure meant to
progressively reduce the space of possible causal models. We propose a novel
efficient Bayesian method for discovering the local causal relationships among
triplets of (normally distributed) variables. In our approach, we score the
patterns in the covariance matrix in one go and we incorporate the available
background knowledge in the form of priors over causal structures. Our method
is flexible in the sense that it allows for different types of causal
structures and assumptions. We apply the approach to the task of inferring gene
regulatory networks by learning regulatory relationships between gene
expression levels. We show that our algorithm produces stable and conservative
posterior probability estimates over local causal structures that can be used
to derive an honest ranking of the most meaningful regulatory relationships. We
demonstrate the stability and efficacy of our method both on simulated data and
on real-world data from an experiment on yeast.

"  Double-stranded DNA may contain mismatched base pairs beyond the Watson-Crick
pairs guanine-cytosine and adenine-thymine. Such mismatches bear adverse
consequences for human health. We utilize molecular dynamics and metadynamics
computer simulations to study the equilibrium structure and dynamics for both
matched and mismatched base pairs. We discover significant differences between
matched and mismatched pairs in structure, hydrogen bonding, and base flip work
profiles. Mismatched pairs shift further in the plane normal to the DNA strand
and are more likely to exhibit non-canonical structures, including the e-motif.
We discuss potential implications on mismatch repair enzymes' detection of DNA
mismatches.

"  Biomedical sciences are increasingly recognising the relevance of gene
co-expression-networks for analysing complex-systems, phenotypes or diseases.
When the goal is investigating complex-phenotypes under varying conditions, it
comes naturally to employ comparative network methods. While approaches for
comparing two networks exist, this is not the case for multiple networks. Here
we present a method for the systematic comparison of an unlimited number of
networks: Co-expression Differential Network Analysis (CoDiNA) for detecting
links and nodes that are common, specific or different to the networks.
Applying CoDiNA to a neurogenesis study identified genes for neuron
differentiation. Experimentally overexpressing one candidate resulted in
significant disturbance in the underlying neurogenesis' gene regulatory
network. We compared data from adults and children with active tuberculosis to
test for signatures of HIV. We also identified common and distinct network
features for particular cancer types with CoDiNA. These studies show that
CoDiNA successfully detects genes associated with the diseases.

"  Despite their vast morphological diversity, many invertebrates have similar
larval forms characterized by ciliary bands, innervated arrays of beating cilia
that facilitate swimming and feeding. Hydrodynamics suggests that these bands
should tightly constrain the behavioral strategies available to the larvae;
however, their apparent ubiquity suggests that these bands also confer
substantial adaptive advantages. Here, we use hydrodynamic techniques to
investigate ""blinking,"" an unusual behavioral phenomenon observed in many
invertebrate larvae in which ciliary bands across the body rapidly change
beating direction and produce transient rearrangement of the local flow field.
Using a general theoretical model combined with quantitative experiments on
starfish larvae, we find that the natural rhythm of larval blinking is
hydrodynamically optimal for inducing strong mixing of the local fluid
environment due to transient streamline crossing, thereby maximizing the
larvae's overall feeding rate. Our results are consistent with previous
hypotheses that filter feeding organisms may use chaotic mixing dynamics to
overcome circulation constraints in viscous environments, and it suggests
physical underpinnings for complex neurally-driven behaviors in early-divergent
animals.

"  The analysis of cancer genomic data has long suffered ""the curse of
dimensionality"". Sample sizes for most cancer genomic studies are a few
hundreds at most while there are tens of thousands of genomic features studied.
Various methods have been proposed to leverage prior biological knowledge, such
as pathways, to more effectively analyze cancer genomic data. Most of the
methods focus on testing marginal significance of the associations between
pathways and clinical phenotypes. They can identify relevant pathways, but do
not involve predictive modeling. In this article, we propose a Pathway-based
Kernel Boosting (PKB) method for integrating gene pathway information for
sample classification, where we use kernel functions calculated from each
pathway as base learners and learn the weights through iterative optimization
of the classification loss function. We apply PKB and several competing methods
to three cancer studies with pathological and clinical information, including
tumor grade, stage, tumor sites, and metastasis status. Our results show that
PKB outperforms other methods, and identifies pathways relevant to the outcome
variables.

"  Our view of the universe of genomic regions harboring various types of
candidate human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) has been markedly expanded
in recent years. To infer the evolutionary origins of loci harboring HSRS,
analyses of conservations patterns of 59,732 loci in Modern Humans, Chimpanzee,
Bonobo, Gorilla, Orangutan, Gibbon, and Rhesus genomes have been performed. Two
major evolutionary pathways have been identified comprising thousands of
sequences that were either inherited from extinct common ancestors (ECAs) or
created de novo in humans after human/chimpanzee split. Thousands of HSRS
appear inherited from ECAs yet bypassed genomes of our closest evolutionary
relatives, presumably due to the incomplete lineage sorting and/or
species-specific loss or regulatory DNA. The bypassing pattern is prominent for
HSRS associated with development and functions of human brain. Common genomic
loci that may contributed to speciation during evolution of Great Apes comprise
248 insertions sites of African Great Ape-specific retrovirus PtERV1 (45.9%; p
= 1.03E-44) intersecting regions harboring 442 HSRS, which are enriched for
HSRS associated with human-specific (HS) changes of gene expression in cerebral
organoids. Among non-human primates (NHP), most significant fractions of
candidate HSRS associated with HS expression changes in both excitatory neurons
(347 loci; 67%) and radial glia (683 loci; 72%) are highly conserved in Gorilla
genome. Modern Humans acquired unique combinations of regulatory sequences
highly conserved in distinct species of six NHP separated by 30 million years
of evolution. Concurrently, this unique mosaic of regulatory sequences
inherited from ECAs was supplemented with 12,486 created de novo HSRS. These
observations support the model of complex continuous speciation process during
evolution of Great Apes that is not likely to occur as an instantaneous event.

"  We use plasmon rulers to follow the conformational dynamics of a single
protein for up to 24 h at a video rate. The plasmon ruler consists of two gold
nanospheres connected by a single protein linker. In our experiment, we follow
the dynamics of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90, which is known
to show open and closed conformations. Our measurements confirm the previously
known conformational dynamics with transition times in the second to minute
time scale and reveals new dynamics on the time scale of minutes to hours.
Plasmon rulers thus extend the observation bandwidth 3/4 orders of magnitude
with respect to single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and
enable the study of molecular dynamics with unprecedented precision.

"  Can deep learning (DL) guide our understanding of computations happening in
biological brain? We will first briefly consider how DL has contributed to the
research on visual object recognition. In the main part we will assess whether
DL could also help us to clarify the computations underlying higher cognitive
functions such as Theory of Mind. In addition, we will compare the objectives
and learning signals of brains and machines, leading us to conclude that simply
scaling up the current DL algorithms will not lead to human level mindreading
skills. We then provide some insights about how to fairly compare human and DL
performance. In the end we find that DL can contribute to our understanding of
biological computations by providing an example of an end-to-end algorithm that
solves the same problems the biological agents face.

"  With the National Toxicology Program issuing its final report on cancer, rats
and cell phone radiation, one can draw the following conclusions from their
data. There is a roughly linear relationship between gliomas (brain cancers)
and schwannomas (cancers of the nerve sheaths around the heart) with increased
absorption of 900 MHz radiofrequency radiation for male rats. The rate of these
cancers in female rats is about one third the rate in male rats; the rate of
gliomas in female humans is about two thirds the rate in male humans. Both of
these observations can be explained by a decrease in sensitivity to chemical
carcinogenesis in both female rats and female humans. The increase in male rat
life spans with increased radiofrequency absorption is due to a reduction in
kidney failure from a decrease in food intake. No such similar increase in the
life span of humans who use cell phones is expected.
"
"  We study the phase diagram of a minority game where three classes of agents
are present. Two types of agents play a risk-loving game that we model by the
standard Snowdrift Game. The behaviour of the third type of agents is coded by
{\em indifference} w.r.t. the game at all: their dynamics is designed to
account for risk-aversion as an innovative behavioral gambit. From this point
of view, the choice of this solitary strategy is enhanced when innovation
starts, while is depressed when it becomes the majority option. This implies
that the payoff matrix of the game becomes dependent on the global awareness of
the agents measured by the relevance of the population of the indifferent
players. The resulting dynamics is non-trivial with different kinds of phase
transition depending on a few model parameters. The phase diagram is studied on
regular as well as complex networks.

"  Many organisms repartition their proteome in a circadian fashion in response
to the daily nutrient changes in their environment. A striking example is
provided by cyanobacteria, which perform photosynthesis during the day to fix
carbon. These organisms not only face the challenge of rewiring their proteome
every 12 hours, but also the necessity of storing the fixed carbon in the form
of glycogen to fuel processes during the night. In this manuscript, we extend
the framework developed by Hwa and coworkers (Scott et al., Science 330, 1099
(2010)) for quantifying the relatinship between growth and proteome composition
to circadian metabolism. We then apply this framework to investigate the
circadian metabolism of the cyanobacterium Cyanothece, which not only fixes
carbon during the day, but also nitrogen during the night, storing it in the
polymer cyanophycin. Our analysis reveals that the need to store carbon and
nitrogen tends to generate an extreme growth strategy, in which the cells
predominantly grow during the day, as observed experimentally. This strategy
maximizes the growth rate over 24 hours, and can be quantitatively understood
by the bacterial growth laws. Our analysis also shows that the slow relaxation
of the proteome, arising from the slow growth rate, puts a severe constraint on
implementing this optimal strategy. Yet, the capacity to estimate the time of
the day, enabled by the circadian clock, makes it possible to anticipate the
daily changes in the environment and mount a response ahead of time. This
significantly enhances the growth rate by counteracting the detrimental effects
of the slow proteome relaxation.
"
"  In this paper, we present a regression framework involving several machine
learning models to estimate water parameters based on hyperspectral data.
Measurements from a multi-sensor field campaign, conducted on the River Elbe,
Germany, represent the benchmark dataset. It contains hyperspectral data and
the five water parameters chlorophyll a, green algae, diatoms, CDOM and
turbidity. We apply a PCA for the high-dimensional data as a possible
preprocessing step. Then, we evaluate the performance of the regression
framework with and without this preprocessing step. The regression results of
the framework clearly reveal the potential of estimating water parameters based
on hyperspectral data with machine learning. The proposed framework provides
the basis for further investigations, such as adapting the framework to
estimate water parameters of different inland waters.

"  We propose a dynamical system of tumor cells proliferation based on
operatorial methods. The approach we propose is quantum-like: we use ladder and
number operators to describe healthy and tumor cells birth and death, and the
evolution is ruled by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian which includes, in a non
reversible way, the basic biological mechanisms we consider for the system. We
show that this approach is rather efficient in describing some processes of the
cells. We further add some medical treatment, described by adding a suitable
term in the Hamiltonian, which controls and limits the growth of tumor cells,
and we propose an optimal approach to stop, and reverse, this growth.

"  In the present work, we develop a delayed Logistic growth model to study the
effects of decontamination on the bacterial population in the ambient
environment. Using the linear stability analysis, we study different case
scenarios, where bacterial population may establish at the positive equilibrium
or go extinct due to increased decontamination. The results are verified using
numerical simulation of the model.

"  Among the more important hallmarks of human intelligence, which any
artificial general intelligence (AGI) should have, are the following. 1. It
must be capable of on-line learning, including with single/few trials. 2.
Memories/knowledge must be permanent over lifelong durations, safe from
catastrophic forgetting. Some confabulation, i.e., semantically plausible
retrieval errors, may gradually accumulate over time. 3. The time to both: a)
learn a new item, and b) retrieve the best-matching / most relevant item(s),
i.e., do similarity-based retrieval, must remain constant throughout the
lifetime. 4. The system should never become full: it must remain able to store
new information, i.e., make new permanent memories, throughout very long
lifetimes. No artificial computational system has been shown to have all these
properties. Here, we describe a neuromorphic associative memory model, Sparsey,
which does, in principle, possess them all. We cite prior results supporting
possession of hallmarks 1 and 3 and sketch an argument, hinging on strongly
recursive, hierarchical, part-whole compositional structure of natural data,
that Sparsey also possesses hallmarks 2 and 4.
"
"  Consolidation of synaptic changes in response to neural activity is thought
to be fundamental for memory maintenance over a timescale of hours. In
experiments, synaptic consolidation can be induced by repeatedly stimulating
presynaptic neurons. However, the effectiveness of such protocols depends
crucially on the repetition frequency of the stimulations and the mechanisms
that cause this complex dependence are unknown. Here we propose a simple
mathematical model that allows us to systematically study the interaction
between the stimulation protocol and synaptic consolidation. We show the
existence of optimal stimulation protocols for our model and, similarly to LTP
experiments, the repetition frequency of the stimulation plays a crucial role
in achieving consolidation. Our results show that the complex dependence of LTP
on the stimulation frequency emerges naturally from a model which satisfies
only minimal bistability requirements.
"
"  We extensively explore networks of weakly unbalanced, leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons for different coupling strength, connectivity,
and by varying the degree of refractoriness, as well as the delay in the spike
transmission. We find that the neural network does not only exhibit a
microscopic (single-neuron) stochastic-like evolution, but also a collective
irregular dynamics (CID). Our analysis is based on the computation of a
suitable order parameter, typically used to characterize synchronization
phenomena and on a detailed scaling analysis (i.e. simulations of different
network sizes). As a result, we can conclude that CID is a true thermodynamic
phase, intrinsically different from the standard asynchronous regime.
"
"  Motivation: Word-based or `alignment-free' methods for phylogeny
reconstruction are much faster than traditional approaches, but they are
generally less accurate. Most of these methods calculate pairwise distances for
a set of input sequences, for example from word frequencies, from so-called
spaced-word matches or from the average length of common substrings.
Results: In this paper, we propose the first word-based approach to tree
reconstruction that is based on multiple sequence comparison and Maximum
Likelihood. Our algorithm first samples small, gap-free alignments involving
four taxa each. For each of these alignments, it then calculates a quartet tree
and, finally, the program Quartet MaxCut is used to infer a super tree topology
for the full set of input taxa from the calculated quartet trees. Experimental
results show that trees calculated with our approach are of high quality.

"  Summary
1. Infectious disease outbreaks in plants threaten ecosystems, agricultural
crops and food trade. Currently, several fungal diseases are affecting forests
worldwide, posing a major risk to tree species, habitats and consequently
ecosystem decay. Prediction and control of disease spread are difficult, mainly
due to the complexity of the interaction between individual components
involved.
2. In this work, we introduce a lattice-based epidemic model coupled with a
stochastic process that mimics, in a very simplified way, the interaction
between the hosts and pathogen. We studied the disease spread by measuring the
propagation velocity of the pathogen on the susceptible hosts. Quantitative
results indicate the occurrence of a critical transition between two stable
phases: local confinement and an extended epiphytotic outbreak that depends on
the density of the susceptible individuals.
3. Quantitative predictions of epiphytotics are performed using the framework
early-warning indicators for impending regime shifts, widely applied on
dynamical systems. These signals forecast successfully the outcome of the
critical shift between the two stable phases before the system enters the
epiphytotic regime.
4. Synthesis: Our study demonstrates that early-warning indicators could be
useful for the prediction of forest disease epidemics through mathematical and
computational models suited to more specific pathogen-host-environmental
interactions.
"
"  In vitro and in vivo spiking activity clearly differ. Whereas networks in
vitro develop strong bursts separated by periods of very little spiking
activity, in vivo cortical networks show continuous activity. This is puzzling
considering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron dynamics
and plasticity rules. We propose that the defining difference between in vitro
and in vivo dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are
virtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input.
We analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by
spike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state.
In more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network
topologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic
plasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to
close-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the
dynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the
input strengths. Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in
vitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting behavior is consistent with a state
generated by very low network input (< 0.1%), whereas in vivo activity suggests
that on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in
reverberating dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the
ubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations, and instead impose dynamics
comparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term
stimulation, thereby opening new paths to establish an in vivo-like assay in
vitro for basic as well as neurological studies.
"
"  In the present work, we use information theory to understand the empirical
convergence rate of tractography, a widely-used approach to reconstruct
anatomical fiber pathways in the living brain. Based on diffusion MRI data,
tractography is the starting point for many methods to study brain
connectivity. Of the available methods to perform tractography, most
reconstruct a finite set of streamlines, or 3D curves, representing probable
connections between anatomical regions, yet relatively little is known about
how the sampling of this set of streamlines affects downstream results, and how
exhaustive the sampling should be. Here we provide a method to measure the
information theoretic surprise (self-cross entropy) for tract sampling schema.
We then empirically assess four streamline methods. We demonstrate that the
relative information gain is very low after a moderate number of streamlines
have been generated for each tested method. The results give rise to several
guidelines for optimal sampling in brain connectivity analyses.

"  The study of neuronal interactions is currently at the center of several
neuroscience big collaborative projects (including the Human Connectome, the
Blue Brain, the Brainome, etc.) which attempt to obtain a detailed map of the
entire brain matrix. Under certain constraints, mathematical theory can advance
predictions of the expected neural dynamics based solely on the statistical
properties of such synaptic interaction matrix. This work explores the
application of free random variables (FRV) to the study of large synaptic
interaction matrices. Besides recovering in a straightforward way known results
on eigenspectra of neural networks, we extend them to heavy-tailed
distributions of interactions. More importantly, we derive analytically the
behavior of eigenvector overlaps, which determine stability of the spectra. We
observe that upon imposing the neuronal excitation/inhibition balance, although
the eigenvalues remain unchanged, their stability dramatically decreases due to
strong non-orthogonality of associated eigenvectors. It leads us to the
conclusion that the understanding of the temporal evolution of asymmetric
neural networks requires considering the entangled dynamics of both
eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which might bear consequences for learning and
memory processes in these models. Considering the success of FRV analysis in a
wide variety of branches disciplines, we hope that the results presented here
foster additional application of these ideas in the area of brain sciences.
"
"  Continuous attractor neural networks generate a set of smoothly connected
attractor states. In memory systems of the brain, these attractor states may
represent continuous pieces of information such as spatial locations and head
directions of animals. However, during the replay of previous experiences,
hippocampal neurons show a discontinuous sequence in which discrete transitions
of neural state are phase-locked with the slow-gamma (30-40 Hz) oscillation.
Here, we explored the underlying mechanisms of the discontinuous sequence
generation. We found that a continuous attractor neural network has several
phases depending on the interactions between external input and local
inhibitory feedback. The discrete-attractor-like behavior naturally emerges in
one of these phases without any discreteness assumption. We propose that the
dynamics of continuous attractor neural networks is the key to generate
discontinuous state changes phase-locked to the brain rhythm.

"  Tumor cells acquire different genetic alterations during the course of
evolution in cancer patients. As a result of competition and selection, only a
few subgroups of cells with distinct genotypes survive. These subgroups of
cells are often referred to as subclones. In recent years, many statistical and
computational methods have been developed to identify tumor subclones, leading
to biologically significant discoveries and shedding light on tumor
progression, metastasis, drug resistance and other processes. However, most
existing methods are either not able to infer the phylogenetic structure among
subclones, or not able to incorporate copy number variations (CNV). In this
article, we propose SIFA (tumor Subclone Identification by Feature Allocation),
a Bayesian model which takes into account both CNV and tumor phylogeny
structure to infer tumor subclones. We compare the performance of SIFA with two
other commonly used methods using simulation studies with varying sequencing
depth, evolutionary tree size, and tree complexity. SIFA consistently yields
better results in terms of Rand Index and cellularity estimation accuracy. The
usefulness of SIFA is also demonstrated through its application to whole genome
sequencing (WGS) samples from four patients in a breast cancer study.

"  What happens when a new social convention replaces an old one? While the
possible forces favoring norm change - such as institutions or committed
activists - have been identified since a long time, little is known about how a
population adopts a new convention, due to the difficulties of finding
representative data. Here we address this issue by looking at changes occurred
to 2,541 orthographic and lexical norms in English and Spanish through the
analysis of a large corpora of books published between the years 1800 and 2008.
We detect three markedly distinct patterns in the data, depending on whether
the behavioral change results from the action of a formal institution, an
informal authority or a spontaneous process of unregulated evolution. We
propose a simple evolutionary model able to capture all the observed behaviors
and we show that it reproduces quantitatively the empirical data. This work
identifies general mechanisms of norm change and we anticipate that it will be
of interest to researchers investigating the cultural evolution of language
and, more broadly, human collective behavior.

"  A practical, biologically motivated case of protein complexes (immunoglobulin
G and FcRII receptors) moving on the surface of mastcells, that are common
parts of an immunological system, is investigated. Proteins are considered as
nanomachines creating a nanonetwork. Accurate molecular models of the proteins
and the fluorophores which act as their nanoantennas are used to simulate the
communication between the nanomachines when they are close to each other. The
theory of diffusion-based Brownian motion is applied to model movements of the
proteins. It is assumed that fluorophore molecules send and receive signals
using the Forster Resonance Energy Transfer. The probability of the efficient
signal transfer and the respective bit error rate are calculated and discussed.

"  Viral zoonoses have emerged as the key drivers of recent pandemics. Human
infection by zoonotic viruses are either spillover events -- isolated
infections that fail to cause a widespread contagion -- or species jumps, where
successful adaptation to the new host leads to a pandemic. Despite expensive
bio-surveillance efforts, historically emergence response has been reactive,
and post-hoc. Here we use machine inference to demonstrate a high accuracy
predictive bio-surveillance capability, designed to pro-actively localize an
impending species jump via automated interrogation of massive sequence
databases of viral proteins. Our results suggest that a jump might not purely
be the result of an isolated unfortunate cross-infection localized in space and
time; there are subtle yet detectable patterns of genotypic changes
accumulating in the global viral population leading up to emergence. Using tens
of thousands of protein sequences simultaneously, we train models that track
maximum achievable accuracy for disambiguating host tropism from the primary
structure of surface proteins, and show that the inverse classification
accuracy is a quantitative indicator of jump risk. We validate our claim in the
context of the 2009 swine flu outbreak, and the 2004 emergence of H5N1
subspecies of Influenza A from avian reservoirs; illustrating that
interrogation of the global viral population can unambiguously track a near
monotonic risk elevation over several preceding years leading to eventual
emergence.

"  Nanocommunications, understood as communications between nanoscale devices,
is commonly regarded as a technology essential for cooperation of large groups
of nanomachines and thus crucial for development of the whole area of
nanotechnology. While solutions for point-to-point nanocommunications have been
already proposed, larger networks cannot function properly without routing. In
this article we focus on the nanocommunications via Forster Resonance Energy
Transfer (FRET), which was found to be a technique with a very high signal
propagation speed, and discuss how to route signals through nanonetworks. We
introduce five new routing mechanisms, based on biological properties of
specific molecules. We experimentally validate one of these mechanisms.
Finally, we analyze open issues showing the technical challenges for signal
transmission and routing in FRET-based nanocommunications.

"  We investigate a time-dependent spatial vector-host epidemic model with
non-coincident domains for the vector and host populations. The host population
resides in small non-overlapping sub-regions, while the vector population
resides throughout a much larger region. The dynamics of the populations are
modeled by a reaction-diffusion-advection compartmental system of partial
differential equations. The disease is transmitted through vector and host
populations in criss-cross fashion. We establish global well-posedness and
uniform a prior bounds as well as the long-term behavior. The model is applied
to simulate the outbreak of bluetongue disease in sheep transmitted by midges
infected with bluetongue virus. We show that the long-range directed movement
of the midge population, due to wind-aided movement, enhances the transmission
of the disease to sheep in distant sites.
"
"  We investigate the dynamics of a dilute suspension of hydrodynamically
interacting motile or immotile stress-generating swimmers or particles as they
invade a surrounding viscous fluid. Colonies of aligned pusher particles are
shown to elongate in the direction of particle orientation and undergo a
cascade of transverse concentration instabilities, governed at small times by
an equation which also describes the Saffman-Taylor instability in a Hele-Shaw
cell, or Rayleigh-Taylor instability in two-dimensional flow through a porous
medium. Thin sheets of aligned pusher particles are always unstable, while
sheets of aligned puller particles can either be stable (immotile particles),
or unstable (motile particles) with a growth rate which is non-monotonic in the
force dipole strength. We also prove a surprising ""no-flow theorem"": a
distribution initially isotropic in orientation loses isotropy immediately but
in such a way that results in no fluid flow everywhere and for all time.
"
"  In this work, we introduce a new type of linear classifier that is
implemented in a chemical form. We propose a novel encoding technique which
simultaneously represents multiple datasets in an array of microliter-scale
chemical mixtures. Parallel computations on these datasets are performed as
robotic liquid handling sequences, whose outputs are analyzed by
high-performance liquid chromatography. As a proof of concept, we chemically
encode several MNIST images of handwritten digits and demonstrate successful
chemical-domain classification of the digits using volumetric perceptrons. We
additionally quantify the performance of our method with a larger dataset of
binary vectors and compare the experimental measurements against predicted
results. Paired with appropriate chemical analysis tools, our approach can work
on increasingly parallel datasets. We anticipate that related approaches will
be scalable to multilayer neural networks and other more complex algorithms.
Much like recent demonstrations of archival data storage in DNA, this work
blurs the line between chemical and electrical information systems, and offers
early insight into the computational efficiency and massive parallelism which
may come with computing in chemical domains.

"  Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity is altered in autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). Heart rate variability (HRV) derived from electrocardiogram
(ECG) has been a powerful tool to identify alterations in ANS due to a plethora
of pathophysiological conditions, including psychological ones such as
depression. ECG-derived HRV thus carries a yet to be explored potential to be
used as a diagnostic and follow-up biomarker of ASD. However, few studies have
explored this potential. In a cohort of boys (ages 8 - 11 years) with (n=18)
and without ASD (n=18), we tested a set of linear and nonlinear HRV measures,
including phase rectified signal averaging (PRSA), applied to a segment of ECG
collected under resting conditions for their predictive properties of ASD. We
identified HRV measures derived from time, frequency and geometric
signal-analytical domains which are changed in ASD children relative to peers
without ASD and correlate to psychometric scores (p<0.05 for each). Receiver
operating curves area ranged between 0.71 - 0.74 for each HRV measure. Despite
being a small cohort lacking external validation, these promising preliminary
results warrant larger prospective validation studies.
"
"  The ecological invasion problem in which a weaker exotic species invades an
ecosystem inhabited by two strongly competing native species is modelled by a
three-species competition-diffusion system. It is known that for a certain
range of parameter values competitor-mediated coexistence occurs and complex
spatio-temporal patterns are observed in two spatial dimensions. In this paper
we uncover the mechanism which generates such patterns. Under some assumptions
on the parameters the three-species competition-diffusion system admits two
planarly stable travelling waves. Their interaction in one spatial dimension
may result in either reflection or merging into a single homoclinic wave,
depending on the strength of the invading species. This transition can be
understood by studying the bifurcation structure of the homoclinic wave. In
particular, a time-periodic homoclinic wave (breathing wave) is born from a
Hopf bifurcation and its unstable branch acts as a separator between the
reflection and merging regimes. The same transition occurs in two spatial
dimensions: the stable regular spiral associated to the homoclinic wave
destabilizes, giving rise first to an oscillating breathing spiral and then
breaking up producing a dynamic pattern characterized by many spiral cores. We
find that these complex patterns are generated by the interaction of two
planarly stable travelling waves, in contrast with many other well known cases
of pattern formation where planar instability plays a central role.
"
"  When three species compete cyclically in a well-mixed, stochastic system of
$N$ individuals, extinction is known to typically occur at times scaling as the
system size $N$. This happens, for example, in rock-paper-scissors games or
conserved Lotka-Volterra models in which every pair of individuals can interact
on a complete graph. Here we show that if the competing individuals also have a
""social temperament"" to be either introverted or extroverted, leading them to
cut or add links respectively, then long-living state in which all species
coexist can occur when both introverts and extroverts are present. These states
are non-equilibrium quasi-steady states, maintained by a subtle balance between
species competition and network dynamcis. Remarkably, much of the phenomena is
embodied in a mean-field description. However, an intuitive understanding of
why diversity stabilizes the co-evolving node and link dynamics remains an open
issue.

"  Cellular Electron Cryo-Tomography (CECT) is a powerful imaging technique for
the 3D visualization of cellular structure and organization at submolecular
resolution. It enables analyzing the native structures of macromolecular
complexes and their spatial organization inside single cells. However, due to
the high degree of structural complexity and practical imaging limitations,
systematic macromolecular structural recovery inside CECT images remains
challenging. Particularly, the recovery of a macromolecule is likely to be
biased by its neighbor structures due to the high molecular crowding. To reduce
the bias, here we introduce a novel 3D convolutional neural network inspired by
Fully Convolutional Network and Encoder-Decoder Architecture for the supervised
segmentation of macromolecules of interest in subtomograms. The tests of our
models on realistically simulated CECT data demonstrate that our new approach
has significantly improved segmentation performance compared to our baseline
approach. Also, we demonstrate that the proposed model has generalization
ability to segment new structures that do not exist in training data.

"  We present novel experimental results on pattern formation of signaling
Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba in the presence of a periodic array of
millimeter-sized pillars. We observe concentric cAMP waves that initiate almost
synchronously at the pillars and propagate outwards. These waves have higher
frequency than the other firing centers and dominate the system dynamics. The
cells respond chemotactically to these circular waves and stream towards the
pillars, forming periodic Voronoi domains that reflect the periodicity of the
underlying lattice. We performed comprehensive numerical simulations of a
reaction-diffusion model to study the characteristics of the boundary
conditions given by the obstacles. Our simulations show that, the obstacles can
act as the wave source depending on the imposed boundary condition.
Interestingly, a critical minimum accumulation of cAMP around the obstacles is
needed for the pillars to act as the wave source. This critical value is lower
at smaller production rates of the intracellular cAMP which can be controlled
in our experiments using caffeine. Experiments and simulations also show that
in the presence of caffeine the number of firing centers is reduced which is
crucial in our system for circular waves emitted from the pillars to
successfully take over the dynamics. These results are crucial to understand
the signaling mechanism of Dictyostelium cells that experience spatial
heterogeneities in its natural habitat.

"  Predicting how a proposed cancer treatment will affect a given tumor can be
cast as a machine learning problem, but the complexity of biological systems,
the number of potentially relevant genomic and clinical features, and the lack
of very large scale patient data repositories make this a unique challenge.
""Pure data"" approaches to this problem are underpowered to detect
combinatorially complex interactions and are bound to uncover false
correlations despite statistical precautions taken (1). To investigate this
setting, we propose a method to integrate simulations, a strong form of prior
knowledge, into machine learning, a combination which to date has been largely
unexplored. The results of multiple simulations (under various uncertainty
scenarios) are used to compute similarity measures between every pair of
samples: sample pairs are given a high similarity score if they behave
similarly under a wide range of simulation parameters. These similarity values,
rather than the original high dimensional feature data, are used to train
kernelized machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, thus
handling the curse-of-dimensionality that typically affects genomic machine
learning. Using four synthetic datasets of complex systems--three biological
models and one network flow optimization model--we demonstrate that when the
number of training samples is small compared to the number of features, the
simulation kernel approach dominates over no-prior-knowledge methods. In
addition to biology and medicine, this approach should be applicable to other
disciplines, such as weather forecasting, financial markets, and agricultural
management, where predictive models are sought and informative yet approximate
simulations are available. The Python SimKern software, the models (in MATLAB,
Octave, and R), and the datasets are made freely available at
this https URL .

"  Probabilistic modeling is fundamental to the statistical analysis of complex
data. In addition to forming a coherent description of the data-generating
process, probabilistic models enable parameter inference about given data sets.
This procedure is well-developed in the Bayesian perspective, in which one
infers probability distributions describing to what extent various possible
parameters agree with the data. In this paper we motivate and review
probabilistic modeling for adaptive immune receptor repertoire data then
describe progress and prospects for future work, from germline haplotyping to
adaptive immune system deployment across tissues. The relevant quantities in
immune sequence analysis include not only continuous parameters such as gene
use frequency, but also discrete objects such as B cell clusters and lineages.
Throughout this review, we unravel the many opportunities for probabilistic
modeling in adaptive immune receptor analysis, including settings for which the
Bayesian approach holds substantial promise (especially if one is optimistic
about new computational methods). From our perspective the greatest prospects
for progress in probabilistic modeling for repertoires concern ancestral
sequence estimation for B cell receptor lineages, including uncertainty from
germline genotype, rearrangement, and lineage development.

"  Zebrafish pretectal neurons exhibit specificities for large-field optic flow
patterns associated with rotatory or translatory body motion. We investigate
the hypothesis that these specificities reflect the input statistics of natural
optic flow. Realistic motion sequences were generated using computer graphics
simulating self-motion in an underwater scene. Local retinal motion was
estimated with a motion detector and encoded in four populations of
directionally tuned retinal ganglion cells, represented as two signed input
variables. This activity was then used as input into one of two learning
networks: a sparse coding network (competitive learning) and backpropagation
network (supervised learning). Both simulations develop specificities for optic
flow which are comparable to those found in a neurophysiological study (Kubo et
al. 2014), and relative frequencies of the various neuronal responses are best
modeled by the sparse coding approach. We conclude that the optic flow neurons
in the zebrafish pretectum do reflect the optic flow statistics. The predicted
vectorial receptive fields show typical optic flow fields but also ""Gabor"" and
dipole-shaped patterns that likely reflect difference fields needed for
reconstruction by linear superposition.

"  Followership is generally defined as a strategy that evolved to solve social
coordination problems, and particularly those involved in group movement.
Followership behaviour is particularly interesting in the context of
road-crossing behaviour because it involves other principles such as
risk-taking and evaluating the value of social information. This study sought
to identify the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making by pedestrians
who follow another person across the road at the green or at the red light in
two different countries (France and Japan). We used agent-based modelling to
simulate the road-crossing behaviours of pedestrians. This study showed that
modelling is a reliable means to test different hypotheses and find the exact
processes underlying decision-making when crossing the road. We found that two
processes suffice to simulate pedestrian behaviours. Importantly, the study
revealed differences between the two nationalities and between sexes in the
decision to follow and cross at the green and at the red light. Japanese
pedestrians are particularly attentive to the number of already departed
pedestrians and the number of waiting pedestrians at the red light, whilst
their French counterparts only consider the number of pedestrians that have
already stepped off the kerb, thus showing the strong conformism of Japanese
people. Finally, the simulations are revealed to be similar to observations,
not only for the departure latencies but also for the number of crossing
pedestrians and the rates of illegal crossings. The conclusion suggests new
solutions for safety in transportation research.

"  An important task for many if not all the scientific domains is efficient
knowledge integration, testing and codification. It is often solved with model
construction in a controllable computational environment. In spite of that, the
throughput of in-silico simulation-based observations become similarly
intractable for thorough analysis. This is especially the case in molecular
biology, which served as a subject for this study. In this project, we aimed to
test some approaches developed to deal with the curse of dimensionality. Among
these we found dimension reduction techniques especially appealing. They can be
used to identify irrelevant variability and help to understand critical
processes underlying high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we subjected our
data sets to nonlinear time series analysis, as those are well established
methods for results comparison. To investigate the usefulness of dimension
reduction methods, we decided to base our study on a concrete sample set. The
example was taken from the domain of systems biology concerning dynamic
evolution of sub-cellular signaling. Particularly, the dataset relates to the
yeast pheromone pathway and is studied in-silico with a stochastic model. The
model reconstructs signal propagation stimulated by a mating pheromone. In the
paper, we elaborate on the reason of multidimensional analysis problem in the
context of molecular signaling, and next, we introduce the model of choice,
simulation details and obtained time series dynamics. A description of used
methods followed by a discussion of results and their biological interpretation
finalize the paper.

"  Artificial neural networks that learn to perform Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and related tasks using strictly local learning rules have been
previously derived based on the principle of similarity matching: similar pairs
of inputs should map to similar pairs of outputs. However, the operation of
these networks (and of similar networks) requires a fixed-point iteration to
determine the output corresponding to a given input, which means that dynamics
must operate on a faster time scale than the variation of the input. Further,
during these fast dynamics such networks typically ""disable"" learning, updating
synaptic weights only once the fixed-point iteration has been resolved. Here,
we derive a network for PCA-based dimensionality reduction that avoids this
fast fixed-point iteration. The key novelty of our approach is a modification
of the similarity matching objective to encourage near-diagonality of a
synaptic weight matrix. We then approximately invert this matrix using a Taylor
series approximation, replacing the previous fast iterations. In the offline
setting, our algorithm corresponds to a dynamical system, the stability of
which we rigorously analyze. In the online setting (i.e., with stochastic
gradients), we map our algorithm to a familiar neural network architecture and
give numerical results showing that our method converges at a competitive rate.
The computational complexity per iteration of our online algorithm is linear in
the total degrees of freedom, which is in some sense optimal.

"  The paper is devoted to the relationship between psychophysics and physics of
mind. The basic trends in psychophysics development are briefly discussed with
special attention focused on Teghtsoonian's hypotheses. These hypotheses pose
the concept of the universality of inner psychophysics and enable to speak
about psychological space as an individual object with its own properties.
Turning to the two-component description of human behavior (I. Lubashevsky,
Physics of the Human Mind, Springer, 2017) the notion of mental space is
formulated and human perception of external stimuli is treated as the emergence
of the corresponding images in the mental space. On one hand, these images are
caused by external stimuli and their magnitude bears the information about the
intensity of the corresponding stimuli. On the other hand, the individual
structure of such images as well as their subsistence after emergence is
determined only by the properties of mental space on its own. Finally, the
mental operations of image comparison and their scaling are defined in a way
allowing for the bounded capacity of human cognition. As demonstrated, the
developed theory of stimulus perception is able to explain the basic
regularities of psychophysics, e.g., (i) the regression and range effects
leading to the overestimation of weak stimuli and the underestimation of strong
stimuli, (ii) scalar variability (Weber's and Ekman' laws), and (\textit{iii})
the sequential (memory) effects. As the final result, a solution to the
Fechner-Stevens dilemma is proposed. This solution posits that Fechner's
logarithmic law is not a consequences of Weber's law but stems from the
interplay of uncertainty in evaluating stimulus intensities and the multi-step
scaling required to overcome the stimulus incommensurability.

"  Acute respiratory infections have epidemic and pandemic potential and thus
are being studied worldwide, albeit in many different contexts and study
formats. Predicting infection from symptom data is critical, though using
symptom data from varied studies in aggregate is challenging because the data
is collected in different ways. Accordingly, different symptom profiles could
be more predictive in certain studies, or even symptoms of the same name could
have different meanings in different contexts. We assess state-of-the-art
transfer learning methods for improving prediction of infection from symptom
data in multiple types of health care data ranging from clinical, to home-visit
as well as crowdsourced studies. We show interesting characteristics regarding
six different study types and their feature domains. Further, we demonstrate
that it is possible to use data collected from one study to predict infection
in another, at close to or better than using a single dataset for prediction on
itself. We also investigate in which conditions specific transfer learning and
domain adaptation methods may perform better on symptom data. This work has the
potential for broad applicability as we show how it is possible to transfer
learning from one public health study design to another, and data collected
from one study may be used for prediction of labels for another, even collected
through different study designs, populations and contexts.

"  Background: The chromatin remodelers of the SWI/SNF family are critical
transcriptional regulators. Recognition of lysine acetylation through a
bromodomain (BRD) component is key to SWI/SNF function; in most eukaryotes,
this function is attributed to SNF2/Brg1.
Results: Using affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) we
identified members of a SWI/SNF complex (SWI/SNFTt) in Tetrahymena thermophila.
SWI/SNFTt is composed of 11 proteins, Snf5Tt, Swi1Tt, Swi3Tt, Snf12Tt, Brg1Tt,
two proteins with potential chromatin interacting domains and four proteins
without orthologs to SWI/SNF proteins in yeast or mammals. SWI/SNFTt subunits
localize exclusively to the transcriptionally active macronucleus (MAC) during
growth and development, consistent with a role in transcription. While
Tetrahymena Brg1 does not contain a BRD, our AP-MS results identified a
BRD-containing SWI/SNFTt component, Ibd1 that associates with SWI/SNFTt during
growth but not development. AP-MS analysis of epitope-tagged Ibd1 revealed it
to be a subunit of several additional protein complexes, including putative
SWRTt, and SAGATt complexes as well as a putative H3K4-specific histone methyl
transferase complex. Recombinant Ibd1 recognizes acetyl-lysine marks on
histones correlated with active transcription. Consistent with our AP-MS and
histone array data suggesting a role in regulation of gene expression, ChIP-Seq
analysis of Ibd1 indicated that it primarily binds near promoters and within
gene bodies of highly expressed genes during growth.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that through recognizing specific histones
marks, Ibd1 targets active chromatin regions of highly expressed genes in
Tetrahymena where it subsequently might coordinate the recruitment of several
chromatin remodeling complexes to regulate the transcriptional landscape of
vegetatively growing Tetrahymena cells.

"  Chromosome conformation capture and Hi-C technologies provide gene-gene
proximity datasets of stationary cells, revealing chromosome territories,
topologically associating domains, and chromosome topology. Imaging of tagged
DNA sequences in live cells through the lac operator reporter system provides
dynamic datasets of chromosomal loci. Chromosome modeling explores the
mechanisms underlying 3D genome structure and dynamics. Here, we automate 4D
genome dataset analysis with network-based tools as an alternative to gene-gene
proximity statistics and visual structure determination. Temporal network
models and community detection algorithms are applied to 4D modeling of G1 in
budding yeast with transient crosslinking of $5 kb$ domains in the nucleolus,
analyzing datasets from four decades of transient binding timescales. Network
tools detect and track transient gene communities (clusters) within the
nucleolus, their size, number, persistence time, and frequency of gene
exchanges. An optimal, weak binding affinity is revealed that maximizes
community-scale plasticity whereby large communities persist, frequently
exchanging genes.

"  Simplistic estimation of neural connectivity in MEEG sensor space is
impossible due to volume conduction. The only viable alternative is to carry
out connectivity estimation in source space. Among the neuroscience community
this is claimed to be impossible or misleading due to Leakage: linear mixing of
the reconstructed sources. To address this problematic we propose a novel
solution method that caulks the Leakage in MEEG source activity and
connectivity estimates: BC-VARETA. It is based on a joint estimation of source
activity and connectivity in the frequency domain representation of MEEG time
series. To achieve this, we go beyond current methods that assume a fixed
gaussian graphical model for source connectivity. In contrast we estimate this
graphical model in a Bayesian framework by placing priors on it, which allows
for highly optimized computations of the connectivity, via a new procedure
based on the local quadratic approximation under quite general prior models. A
further contribution of this paper is the rigorous definition of leakage via
the Spatial Dispersion Measure and Earth Movers Distance based on the geodesic
distances over the cortical manifold. Both measures are extended for the first
time to quantify Connectivity Leakage by defining them on the cartesian product
of cortical manifolds. Using these measures, we show that BC-VARETA outperforms
most state of the art inverse solvers by several orders of magnitude.

"  The so-called binary perfect phylogeny with persistent characters has
recently been thoroughly studied in computational biology as it is less
restrictive than the well known binary perfect phylogeny. Here, we focus on the
notion of (binary) persistent characters, i.e. characters that can be realized
on a phylogenetic tree by at most one $0 \rightarrow 1$ transition followed by
at most one $1 \rightarrow 0$ transition in the tree, and analyze these
characters under different aspects. First, we illustrate the connection between
persistent characters and Maximum Parsimony, where we characterize persistent
characters in terms of the first phase of the famous Fitch algorithm.
Afterwards we focus on the number of persistent characters for a given
phylogenetic tree. We show that this number solely depends on the balance of
the tree. To be precise, we develop a formula for counting the number of
persistent characters for a given phylogenetic tree based on an index of tree
balance, namely the Sackin index. Lastly, we consider the question of how many
(carefully chosen) binary characters together with their persistence status are
needed to uniquely determine a phylogenetic tree and provide an upper bound for
the number of characters needed.

"  Limitations in processing capabilities and memory of today's computers make
spiking neuron-based (human) whole-brain simulations inevitably characterized
by a compromise between bio-plausibility and computational cost. It translates
into brain models composed of a reduced number of neurons and a simplified
neuron's mathematical model. Taking advantage of the sparse character of
brain-like computation, eventdriven technique allows us to carry out efficient
simulation of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). The recent Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire with Latency (LIFL) spiking neuron model is event-driven
compatible and exhibits some realistic neuronal features, opening new horizons
in whole-brain modelling. In this paper we present FNS, a LIFL-based exact
event-driven spiking neural network framework implemented in Java and oriented
to wholebrain simulations. FNS combines spiking/synaptic whole-brain modelling
with the event-driven approach, allowing us to define heterogeneous modules and
multi-scale connectivity with delayed connections and plastic synapses,
providing fast simulations at the same time. A novel parallelization strategy
is also implemented in order to further speed up simulations. This paper
presents mathematical models, software implementation and simulation routines
on which FNS is based. Finally, a reduced brain network model (1400 neurons and
45000 synapses) is synthesized on the basis of real brain structural data, and
the resulting model activity is compared with associated brain functional
(source-space MEG) data. The conducted test shows a good matching between the
activity of model and that of the emulated subject, in outstanding simulation
times (about 20s for simulating 4s of activity with a normal PC). Dedicated
sections of stimuli editing and output synthesis allow the neuroscientist to
introduce and extract brain-like signals, respectively...

"  Feedback control theory has been extensively implemented to theoretically
model human sensorimotor control. However, experimental platforms capable of
manipulating important components of multiple feedback loops lack development.
This paper describes the WheelCon, which is an open source platform aimed at
resolving such insufficiencies. WheelCon enables safely simulation of the
canonical sensorimotor task such as riding a mountain bike down a steep,
twisting, bumpy trail etc., with provided only a computer, standard display,
and an inexpensive gaming steering wheel with a force feedback motor. The
platform provides flexibility, as will be demonstrated in the demos provided,
so that researchers may manipulate the disturbances, delay, and quantization
(data rate) in the layered feedback loops, including a high-level advanced plan
layer and a low-level delayed reflex layer. In this paper, we illustrate
WheelCon's graphical user interface (GUI), the input and output of existing
demos, and how to design new games. In addition, we present the basic feedback
model, and we show the testing results from our demo games which align well
with prediction from the model. In short, the platform is featured as cheap,
simple to use, and flexible to program for effective sensorimotor neuroscience
research and control engineering education.

"  Recovery of multispecies oral biofilms is investigated following treatment by
chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), iodine-potassium iodide (IPI) and Sodium
hypochlorite (NaOCl) both experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally,
biofilms taken from two donors were exposed to the three antibacterial
solutions (irrigants) for 10 minutes, respectively. We observe that (a) live
bacterial cell ratios decline for a week after the exposure and the trend
reverses beyond a week; after fifteen weeks, live bacterial cell ratios in
biofilms fully return to their pretreatment levels; (b) NaOCl is shown as the
strongest antibacterial agent for the oral biofilms; (c) multispecies oral
biofilms from different donors showed no difference in their susceptibility to
all the bacterial solutions. Guided by the experiment, a mathematical model for
biofilm dynamics is developed, accounting for multiple bacterial phenotypes,
quorum sensing, and growth factor proteins, to describe the nonlinear time
evolutionary behavior of the biofilms. The model captures time evolutionary
dynamics of biofilms before and after antibacterial treatment very well. It
reveals the crucial role played by quorum sensing molecules and growth factors
in biofilm recovery and verifies that the source of biofilms has a minimal to
their recovery. The model is also applied to describe the state of biofilms of
various ages treated by CHX, IPI and NaOCl, taken from different donors. Good
agreement with experimental data predicted by the model is obtained as well,
confirming its applicability to modeling biofilm dynamics in general.

"  It is shown that the Ising distribution can be treated as a latent variable
model, where a set of N real-valued, correlated random variables are drawn and
used to generate N binary spins independently. This allows to approximate the
Ising distribution by a simpler model where the latent variables follow a
multivariate normal distribution, the so-called Cox distribution. The
approximation is formally related to an advanced mean field technique known as
adaptive TAP, and its domain of validity is similar. When valid, it allows a
principled replacement of the Ising distribution by a distribution much easier
to sample and manipulate.

"  The Minimum Error Correction (MEC) approach is used as a metric for
reconstruction of haplotypes from NGS reads. In this paper, we show that the
MEC may encounter with imprecise reconstructed haplotypes for some NGS devices.
Specifically, using mathematical derivations, we evaluate this approach for the
SOLiD, Illumina, 454, Ion, Pacific BioSciences, Oxford Nanopore, and 10X
Genomics devices. Our results reveal that the MEC yields inexact haplotypes for
the Illumina MiniSeq, 454 GS Junior+, Ion PGM 314, and Oxford Nanopore MK 1
MinION.

"  The assumption that action and perception can be investigated independently
is entrenched in theories, models and experimental approaches across the brain
and mind sciences. In cognitive science, this has been a central point of
contention between computationalist and 4Es (enactive, embodied, extended and
embedded) theories of cognition, with the former embracing the ""classical
sandwich"", modular, architecture of the mind and the latter actively denying
this separation can be made. In this work we suggest that the modular
independence of action and perception strongly resonates with the separation
principle of control theory and furthermore that this principle provides formal
criteria within which to evaluate the implications of the modularity of action
and perception. We will also see that real-time feedback with the environment,
often considered necessary for the definition of 4Es ideas, is not however a
sufficient condition to avoid the ""classical sandwich"". Finally, we argue that
an emerging framework in the cognitive and brain sciences, active inference,
extends ideas derived from control theory to the study of biological systems
while disposing of the separation principle, describing non-modular models of
behaviour strongly aligned with 4Es theories of cognition.

"  The question of continuous-versus-discrete information representation in the
brain is a fundamental yet unresolved physiological question. Historically,
most analyses assume a continuous representation without considering the
alternative possibility of a discrete representation. Our work explores the
plausibility of both representations, and answers the question from a
communications engineering perspective. Drawing on the well-established
Shannon's communications theory, we posit that information in the brain is
represented in a discrete form. Using a computer simulation, we show that
information cannot be communicated reliably between neurons using a continuous
representation, due to the presence of noise; neural information has to be in a
discrete form. In addition, we designed 3 (human) behavioral experiments on
probability estimation and analyzed the data using a novel discrete (quantized)
model of probability. Under a discrete model of probability, two distinct
probabilities (say, 0.57 and 0.58) are treated indifferently. We found that
data from all participants were better fit to discrete models than continuous
ones. Furthermore, we re-analyzed the data from a published (human) behavioral
study on intertemporal choice using a novel discrete (quantized) model of
intertemporal choice. Under such a model, two distinct time delays (say, 16
days and 17 days) are treated indifferently. We found corroborating results,
showing that data from all participants were better fit to discrete models than
continuous ones. In summary, all results reported here support our discrete
hypothesis of information representation in the brain, which signifies a major
demarcation from the current understanding of the brain's physiology.

"  Volume transmission is an important neural communication pathway in which
neurons in one brain region influence the neurotransmitter concentration in the
extracellular space of a distant brain region. In this paper, we apply
asymptotic analysis to a stochastic partial differential equation model of
volume transmission to calculate the neurotransmitter concentration in the
extracellular space. Our model involves the diffusion equation in a
three-dimensional domain with interior holes that randomly switch between being
either sources or sinks. These holes model nerve varicosities that alternate
between releasing and absorbing neurotransmitter, according to when they fire
action potentials. In the case that the holes are small, we compute
analytically the first two nonzero terms in an asymptotic expansion of the
average neurotransmitter concentration. The first term shows that the
concentration is spatially constant to leading order and that this constant is
independent of many details in the problem. Specifically, this constant first
term is independent of the number and location of nerve varicosities, neural
firing correlations, and the size and geometry of the extracellular space. The
second term shows how these factors affect the concentration at second order.
Interestingly, the second term is also spatially constant under some mild
assumptions. We verify our asymptotic results by high-order numerical
simulation using radial basis function-generated finite differences.

"  Angiogenesis - the growth of new blood vessels from a pre-existing
vasculature - is key in both physiological processes and on several
pathological scenarios such as cancer progression or diabetic retinopathy. For
the new vascular networks to be functional, it is required that the growing
sprouts merge either with an existing functional mature vessel or with another
growing sprout. This process is called anastomosis. We present a systematic 2D
and 3D computational study of vessel growth in a tissue to address the
capability of angiogenic factor gradients to drive anastomosis formation. We
consider that these growth factors are produced only by tissue cells in
hypoxia, i.e. until nearby vessels merge and become capable of carrying blood
and irrigating their vicinity. We demonstrate that this increased production of
angiogenic factors by hypoxic cells is able to promote vessel anastomoses
events in both 2D and 3D. The simulations also verify that the morphology of
these networks has an increased resilience toward variations in the endothelial
cell's proliferation and chemotactic response. The distribution of tissue
cell`s and the concentration of the growth factors they produce are the major
factors in determining the final morphology of the network.

"  The idea of incompetence as a learning or adaptation function was introduced
in the context of evolutionary games as a fixed parameter. However, live
organisms usually perform different nonlinear adaptation functions such as a
power law or exponential fitness growth. Here, we examine how the functional
form of the learning process may affect the social competition between
different behavioral types. Further, we extend our results for the evolutionary
games where fluctuations in the environment affect the behavioral adaptation of
competing species and demonstrate importance of the starting level of
incompetence for survival. Hence, we define a new concept of learning
advantages that becomes crucial when environments are constantly changing and
requiring rapid adaptation from species. This may lead to the evolutionarily
weak phase when even evolutionary stable populations become vulnerable to
invasions.

"  We axiomatize the molecular-biology reasoning style, verify compliance of the
standard reference: Ptashne, A Genetic Switch, and present proof-theory-induced
technologies to predict phenotypes and life cycles from genotypes. The key is
to note that `reductionist discipline' entails constructive reasoning, i.e.,
that any argument for a compound property is constructed from more basic
arguments. Proof theory makes explicit the inner structure of the axiomatized
reasoning style and allows the permissible dynamics to be presented as a mode
of computation that can be executed and analyzed. Constructivity and
executability guarantee simulation when working over domain-specific languages.
Here, we exhibit phenotype properties for genotype reasons: a molecular-biology
argument is an open-system concurrent computation that results in compartment
changes and is performed among processes of physiology change as determined
from the molecular programming of given DNA. Life cycles are the possible
sequentializations of the processes. A main implication of our construction is
that technical correctness provides a complementary perspective on science that
is as fundamental there as it is for pure mathematics, provided mature
reductionism exists.

"  The rapid advancement in high-throughput techniques has fueled the generation
of large volume of biological data rapidly with low cost. Some of these
techniques are microarray and next generation sequencing which provides genome
level insight of living cells. As a result, the size of most of the biological
databases, such as NCBI-GEO, NCBI-SRA, is exponentially growing. These
biological data are analyzed using computational techniques for knowledge
discovery - which is one of the objectives of bioinformatics research. Gene
regulatory network (GRN) is a gene-gene interaction network which plays pivotal
role in understanding gene regulation process and disease studies. From the
last couple of decades, the researchers are interested in developing
computational algorithms for GRN inference (GRNI) using high-throughput
experimental data. Several computational approaches have been applied for
inferring GRN from gene expression data including statistical techniques
(correlation coefficient), information theory (mutual information), regression
based approaches, probabilistic approaches (Bayesian networks, naive byes),
artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic, along with its
hybridization with other intelligent approach, is well studied in GRNI due to
its several advantages. In this paper, we present a consolidated review on
fuzzy logic and its hybrid approaches for GRNI developed during last two
decades.

"  Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) aims to explore similarities
between neural activities of different stimuli. Classical RSA techniques employ
the inverse of the covariance matrix to explore a linear model between the
neural activities and task events. However, calculating the inverse of a
large-scale covariance matrix is time-consuming and can reduce the stability
and robustness of the final analysis. Notably, it becomes severe when the
number of samples is too large. For facing this shortcoming, this paper
proposes a novel RSA method called gradient-based RSA (GRSA). Moreover, the
proposed method is not restricted to a linear model. In fact, there is a
growing interest in finding more effective ways of using multi-subject and
whole-brain fMRI data. Searchlight technique can extend RSA from the localized
brain regions to the whole-brain regions with smaller memory footprint in each
process. Based on Searchlight, we propose a new method called Spatiotemporal
Searchlight GRSA (SSL-GRSA) that generalizes our ROI-based GRSA algorithm to
the whole-brain data. Further, our approach can handle some computational
challenges while dealing with large-scale, multi-subject fMRI data.
Experimental studies on multi-subject datasets confirm that both proposed
approaches achieve superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA
algorithms.

"  Identifying community structure of a complex network provides insight to the
interdependence between the network topology and emergent collective behaviors
of networks, while detecting such invariant communities in a time-varying

community and newly propose the concept of dynamic modularity to evaluate the
stable community structures in time-varying networks, which is robust against
small changes as verified by several empirical time-varying network datasets.
Besides, using the volatility features of temporal stable communities in
functional brain networks, we successfully differentiate the ADHD (Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) patients and healthy controls efficiently.

"  Life is a complex biological phenomenon represented by numerous chemical,
physical and biological processes performed by a biothermodynamic
system/cell/organism. Both living organisms and inanimate objects are subject
to aging, a biological and physicochemical process characterized by changes in
biological and thermodynamic state. Thus, the same physical laws govern
processes in both animate and inanimate matter. All life processes lead to
change of an organism's state. The change of biological and thermodynamic state
of an organism in time underlies all of three kinds of aging (chronological,
biological and thermodynamic). Life and aging of an organism both start at the
moment of fertilization and continue through entire lifespan. Fertilization
represents formation of a new organism. The new organism represents a new
thermodynamic system. From the very beginning, it changes its state by changing
thermodynamic parameters. The change of thermodynamic parameters is observed as
aging and can be related to change in entropy. Entropy is thus the parameter
that is related to all others and describes aging in the best manner. In the
beginning, entropy change appears as a consequence of accumulation of matter
(growth). Later, decomposition and configurational changes dominate, as a
consequence of various chemical reactions (free radical, decomposition,
fragmentation, accumulation of lipofuscin-like substances...).

[bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and GB1]. In these systems, at the
temperature used, the peptide can be folded or unfolded and bound or unbound to
crowder molecules. Four or five major free-energy minima can be identified. To
estimate the dominant MC relaxation times of the peptide, we build MSMs using a
range of different time resolutions or lag times. We show that stable
relaxation-time estimates can be obtained from the MSM eigenfunctions through
fits to autocorrelation data. The eigenfunctions remain sufficiently accurate
to permit stable relaxation-time estimation down to small lag times, at which
point simple estimates based on the corresponding eigenvalues have large
systematic uncertainties. The presence of the crowders have a stabilizing
effect on the peptide, especially with BPTI crowders, which can be attributed
to a reduced unfolding rate $k_\text{u}$, while the folding rate $k_\text{f}$
is left largely unchanged.

"  Many researches demonstrated that the DNA methylation, which occurs in the
context of a CpG, has strong correlation with diseases, including cancer. There
is a strong interest in analyzing the DNA methylation data to find how to
distinguish different subtypes of the tumor. However, the conventional
statistical methods are not suitable for analyzing the highly dimensional DNA
methylation data with bounded support. In order to explicitly capture the
properties of the data, we design a deep neural network, which composes of
several stacked binary restricted Boltzmann machines, to learn the low
dimensional deep features of the DNA methylation data. Experiments show these
features perform best in breast cancer DNA methylation data cluster analysis,
comparing with some state-of-the-art methods.

"  Empirical observations show that ecological communities can have a huge
number of coexisting species, also with few or limited number of resources.
These ecosystems are characterized by multiple type of interactions, in
particular displaying cooperative behaviors. However, standard modeling of
population dynamics based on Lotka-Volterra type of equations predicts that
ecosystem stability should decrease as the number of species in the community
increases and that cooperative systems are less stable than communities with
only competitive and/or exploitative interactions. Here we propose a stochastic
model of population dynamics, which includes exploitative interactions as well
as cooperative interactions induced by cross-feeding. The model is exactly
solved and we obtain results for relevant macro-ecological patterns, such as
species abundance distributions and correlation functions. In the large system
size limit, any number of species can coexist for a very general class of
interaction networks and stability increases as the number of species grows.
For pure mutualistic/commensalistic interactions we determine the topological
properties of the network that guarantee species coexistence. We also show that
the stationary state is globally stable and that inferring species interactions
through species abundance correlation analysis may be misleading. Our
theoretical approach thus show that appropriate models of cooperation naturally
leads to a solution of the long-standing question about complexity-stability
paradox and on how highly biodiverse communities can coexist.

"  Asymmetric segregation of key proteins at cell division -- be it a beneficial
or deleterious protein -- is ubiquitous in unicellular organisms and often
considered as an evolved trait to increase fitness in a stressed environment.
Here, we provide a general framework to describe the evolutionary origin of
this asymmetric segregation. We compute the population fitness as a function of
the protein segregation asymmetry $a$, and show that the value of $a$ which
optimizes the population growth manifests a phase transition between symmetric
and asymmetric partitioning phases. Surprisingly, the nature of phase
transition is different for the case of beneficial proteins as opposed to
proteins which decrease the single-cell growth rate. Our study elucidates the
optimization problem faced by evolution in the context of protein segregation,
and motivates further investigation of asymmetric protein segregation in
biological systems.

"  Recently, it has become feasible to generate large-scale, multi-tissue gene
expression data, where expression profiles are obtained from multiple tissues
or organs sampled from dozens to hundreds of individuals. When traditional
clustering methods are applied to this type of data, important information is
lost, because they either require all tissues to be analyzed independently,
ignoring dependencies and similarities between tissues, or to merge tissues in
a single, monolithic dataset, ignoring individual characteristics of tissues.
We developed a Bayesian model-based multi-tissue clustering algorithm, revamp,
which can incorporate prior information on physiological tissue similarity, and
which results in a set of clusters, each consisting of a core set of genes
conserved across tissues as well as differential sets of genes specific to one
or more subsets of tissues. Using data from seven vascular and metabolic
tissues from over 100 individuals in the STockholm Atherosclerosis Gene
Expression (STAGE) study, we demonstrate that multi-tissue clusters inferred by
revamp are more enriched for tissue-dependent protein-protein interactions
compared to alternative approaches. We further demonstrate that revamp results
in easily interpretable multi-tissue gene expression associations to key
coronary artery disease processes and clinical phenotypes in the STAGE
individuals. Revamp is implemented in the Lemon-Tree software, available at

"  Proteins are commonly used by biochemical industry for numerous processes.
Refining these proteins' properties via mutations causes stability effects as
well. Accurate computational method to predict how mutations affect protein
stability are necessary to facilitate efficient protein design. However,
accuracy of predictive models is ultimately constrained by the limited
availability of experimental data. We have developed mGPfusion, a novel
Gaussian process (GP) method for predicting protein's stability changes upon
single and multiple mutations. This method complements the limited experimental
data with large amounts of molecular simulation data. We introduce a Bayesian
data fusion model that re-calibrates the experimental and in silico data
sources and then learns a predictive GP model from the combined data. Our
protein-specific model requires experimental data only regarding the protein of
interest and performs well even with few experimental measurements. The
mGPfusion models proteins by contact maps and infers the stability effects
caused by mutations with a mixture of graph kernels. Our results show that
mGPfusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting protein stability
on a dataset of 15 different proteins and that incorporating molecular
simulation data improves the model learning and prediction accuracy.

"  As a living information and communications system, the genome encodes
patterns in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reflecting human adaption
that optimizes population survival in differing environments. This paper
mathematically models environmentally induced adaptive forces that quantify
changes in the distribution of SNP frequencies between populations. We make
direct connections between biophysical methods (e.g. minimizing genomic free
energy) and concepts in population genetics. Our unbiased computer program
scanned a large set of SNPs in the major histocompatibility complex region, and
flagged an altitude dependency on a SNP associated with response to oxygen
deprivation. The statistical power of our double-blind approach is demonstrated
in the flagging of mathematical functional correlations of SNP
information-based potentials in multiple populations with specific
environmental parameters. Furthermore, our approach provides insights for new
discoveries on the biology of common variants. This paper demonstrates the
power of biophysical modeling of population diversity for better understanding
genome-environment interactions in biological phenomenon.

"  We present a novel mechanism for resolving the mechanical rigidity of
nanoscopic circular polymers that flow in a complex environment. The emergence
of a regime of negative differential mobility induced by topological
interactions between the rings and the substrate is the key mechanism for
selective sieving of circular polymers with distinct flexibilities. A simple
model accurately describes the sieving process observed in molecular dynamics
simulations and yields experimentally verifiable analytical predictions, which
can be used as a reference guide for improving filtration procedures of
circular filaments. The topological sieving mechanism we propose ought to be
relevant also in probing the microscopic details of complex substrates.

"  Motivated by applications in protein function prediction, we consider a
challenging supervised classification setting in which positive labels are
scarce and there are no explicit negative labels. The learning algorithm must
thus select which unlabeled examples to use as negative training points,
possibly ending up with an unbalanced learning problem. We address these issues
by proposing an algorithm that combines active learning (for selecting negative
examples) with imbalance-aware learning (for mitigating the label imbalance).
In our experiments we observe that these two techniques operate
synergistically, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard protein
function prediction benchmarks.

"  Evolutionary game dynamics in structured populations has been extensively
explored in past decades. However, most previous studies assume that payoffs of
individuals are fully determined by the strategic behaviors of interacting
parties and social ties between them only serve as the indicator of the
existence of interactions. This assumption neglects important information
carried by inter-personal social ties such as genetic similarity, geographic
proximity, and social closeness, which may crucially affect the outcome of
interactions. To model these situations, we present a framework of evolutionary
multiplayer games on graphs with edge diversity, where different types of edges
describe diverse social ties. Strategic behaviors together with social ties
determine the resulting payoffs of interactants. Under weak selection, we
provide a general formula to predict the success of one behavior over the
other. We apply this formula to various examples which cannot be dealt with
using previous models, including the division of labor and relationship- or
edge-dependent games. We find that labor division facilitates collective
cooperation by decomposing a many-player game into several games of smaller
sizes. The evolutionary process based on relationship-dependent games can be
approximated by interactions under a transformed and unified game. Our work
stresses the importance of social ties and provides effective methods to reduce
the calculating complexity in analyzing the evolution of realistic systems.
"
"  B cells develop high affinity receptors during the course of affinity
maturation, a cyclic process of mutation and selection. At the end of affinity
maturation, a number of cells sharing the same ancestor (i.e. in the same
""clonal family"") are released from the germinal center, their amino acid
frequency profile reflects the allowed and disallowed substitutions at each
position. These clonal-family-specific frequency profiles, called ""substitution
profiles"", are useful for studying the course of affinity maturation as well as
for antibody engineering purposes. However, most often only a single sequence
is recovered from each clonal family in a sequencing experiment, making it
impossible to construct a clonal-family-specific substitution profile. Given
the public release of many high-quality large B cell receptor datasets, one may
ask whether it is possible to use such data in a prediction model for
clonal-family-specific substitution profiles. In this paper, we present the
method ""Substitution Profiles Using Related Families"" (SPURF), a penalized
tensor regression framework that integrates information from a rich assemblage
of datasets to predict the clonal-family-specific substitution profile for any
single input sequence. Using this framework, we show that substitution profiles
from similar clonal families can be leveraged together with simulated
substitution profiles and germline gene sequence information to improve
prediction. We fit this model on a large public dataset and validate the
robustness of our approach on an external dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
command-line tool in an open-source software package
(this https URL) implementing these ideas and providing easy
prediction using our pre-fit models.

"  Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy.
Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate
particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication
cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a persistent infection of a
host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an
apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain
unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been
described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection,
suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible
evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the
putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy affect its epidemiology, or
if an explicit advantage is needed to explain its ecological persistence. To
disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of
multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading
dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the
spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using
both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host
contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of
ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and
commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to
fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism
allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the
monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its
spread. We conjecture that there might have been an increase in the diversity
and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of
agricultural practices.
"
"  Hierarchy is an efficient way for a group to organize, but often goes along
with inequality that benefits leaders. To control despotic behaviour, followers
can assess leaders decisions by aggregating their own and their neighbours
experience, and in response challenge despotic leaders. But in hierarchical
social networks, this interactional justice can be limited by (i) the high
influence of a small clique who are treated better, and (ii) the low
connectedness of followers. Here we study how the connectedness of a social
network affects the co-evolution of despotism in leaders and tolerance to
despotism in followers. We simulate the evolution of a population of agents,
where the influence of an agent is its number of social links. Whether a leader
remains in power is controlled by the overall satisfaction of group members, as
determined by their joint assessment of the leaders behaviour. We demonstrate
that centralization of a social network around a highly influential clique
greatly increases the level of despotism. This is because the clique is more
satisfied, and their higher influence spreads their positive opinion of the
leader throughout the network. Finally, our results suggest that increasing the
connectedness of followers limits despotism while maintaining hierarchy.

"  Bioinformatics tools have been developed to interpret gene expression data at
the gene set level, and these gene set based analyses improve the biologists'
capability to discover functional relevance of their experiment design. While
elucidating gene set individually, inter gene sets association is rarely taken
into consideration. Deep learning, an emerging machine learning technique in
computational biology, can be used to generate an unbiased combination of gene
set, and to determine the biological relevance and analysis consistency of
these combining gene sets by leveraging large genomic data sets. In this study,
we proposed a gene superset autoencoder (GSAE), a multi-layer autoencoder model
with the incorporation of a priori defined gene sets that retain the crucial
biological features in the latent layer. We introduced the concept of the gene
superset, an unbiased combination of gene sets with weights trained by the
autoencoder, where each node in the latent layer is a superset. Trained with
genomic data from TCGA and evaluated with their accompanying clinical
parameters, we showed gene supersets' ability of discriminating tumor subtypes
and their prognostic capability. We further demonstrated the biological
relevance of the top component gene sets in the significant supersets. Using
autoencoder model and gene superset at its latent layer, we demonstrated that
gene supersets retain sufficient biological information with respect to tumor
subtypes and clinical prognostic significance. Superset also provides high
reproducibility on survival analysis and accurate prediction for cancer
subtypes.

"  Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) respond when an animal
occupies a periodic lattice of ""grid fields"" in the environment. The grids are
organized in modules with spatial periods clustered around discrete values
separated by constant ratios reported in the range 1.3-1.8. We propose a
mechanism for dynamical self-organization in the mEC that can produce this
modular structure. In attractor network models of grid formation, the period of
a single module is set by the length scale of recurrent inhibition between
neurons. We show that grid cells will instead form a hierarchy of discrete
modules if a continuous increase in inhibition distance along the dorso-ventral
axis of the mEC is accompanied by excitatory interactions along this axis.
Moreover, constant scale ratios between successive modules arise through
geometric relationships between triangular grids, whose lattice constants are
separated by $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.7$, $\sqrt{7}/2 \approx 1.3$, or other ratios.
We discuss how the interactions required by our model might be tested
experimentally and realized by circuits in the mEC.

"  The analysis of the demographic transition of the past century and a half,
using both empirical data and mathematical models, has rendered a wealth of
well-established facts, including the dramatic increases in life expectancy.
Despite these insights, such analyses have also occasionally triggered debates
which spill over many disciplines, from genetics, to biology, or demography.
Perhaps the hottest discussion is happening around the question of maximum
human lifespan, which --besides its fascinating historical and philosophical
interest-- poses urgent pragmatic warnings on a number of issues in public and
private decision-making. In this paper, we add to the controversy some results
which, based on purely statistical grounds, suggest that the maximum human
lifespan is not fixed, or has not reached yet a plateau. Quite the contrary,
analysis on reliable data for over 150 years in more than 20 industrialized
countries point at a sustained increase in the maximum age at death.
Furthermore, were this trend to continue, a limitless lifespan could be
achieved by 2102. Finally, we quantify the dependence of increases in the
maximum lifespan on socio-economic factors. Our analysis indicates that in some
countries the observed rising patterns can only be sustained by progressively
larger increases in GDP, setting the problem of longevity in a context of
diminishing returns.

"  An explosion of high-throughput DNA sequencing in the past decade has led to
a surge of interest in population-scale inference with whole-genome data.
Recent work in population genetics has centered on designing inference methods
for relatively simple model classes, and few scalable general-purpose inference
techniques exist for more realistic, complex models. To achieve this, two
inferential challenges need to be addressed: (1) population data are
exchangeable, calling for methods that efficiently exploit the symmetries of
the data, and (2) computing likelihoods is intractable as it requires
integrating over a set of correlated, extremely high-dimensional latent
variables. These challenges are traditionally tackled by likelihood-free
methods that use scientific simulators to generate datasets and reduce them to
hand-designed, permutation-invariant summary statistics, often leading to
inaccurate inference. In this work, we develop an exchangeable neural network
that performs summary statistic-free, likelihood-free inference. Our framework
can be applied in a black-box fashion across a variety of simulation-based
tasks, both within and outside biology. We demonstrate the power of our
approach on the recombination hotspot testing problem, outperforming the
state-of-the-art.

"  A variety of complex systems exhibit different types of relationships
simultaneously that can be modeled by multiplex networks. A typical problem is
to determine the community structure of such systems that, in general, depend
on one or more parameters to be tuned. In this study we propose one measure,
grounded on information theory, to find the optimal value of the relax rate
characterizing Multiplex Infomap, the generalization of the Infomap algorithm
to the realm of multilayer networks. We evaluate our methodology on synthetic
networks, to show that the most representative community structure can be
reliably identified when the most appropriate relax rate is used. Capitalizing
on these results, we use this measure to identify the most reliable meso-scale
functional organization in the human protein-protein interaction multiplex
network and compare the observed clusters against a collection of independently
annotated gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Our
analysis reveals that modules obtained with the optimal value of the relax rate
are biologically significant and, remarkably, with higher functional content
than the ones obtained from the aggregate representation of the human proteome.
Our framework allows us to characterize the meso-scale structure of those
multilayer systems whose layers are not explicitly interconnected each other --
as in the case of edge-colored models -- the ones describing most biological
networks, from proteomes to connectomes.
"
"  We present a new non-Archimedean model of evolutionary dynamics, in which the
genomes are represented by p-adic numbers. In this model the genomes have a
variable length, not necessarily bounded, in contrast with the classical models
where the length is fixed. The time evolution of the concentration of a given
genome is controlled by a p-adic evolution equation. This equation depends on a
fitness function f and on mutation measure Q. By choosing a mutation measure of
Gibbs type, and by using a p-adic version of the Maynard Smith Ansatz, we show
the existence of threshold function M_{c}(f,Q), such that the long term
survival of a genome requires that its length grows faster than M_{c}(f,Q).
This implies that Eigen's paradox does not occur if the complexity of genomes
grows at the right pace. About twenty years ago, Scheuring and Poole, Jeffares,
Penny proposed a hypothesis to explain Eigen's paradox. Our mathematical model
shows that this biological hypothesis is feasible, but it requires p-adic
analysis instead of real analysis. More exactly, the Darwin-Eigen cycle
proposed by Poole et al. takes place if the length of the genomes exceeds
M_{c}(f,Q).

"  Representation learning is at the heart of what makes deep learning
effective. In this work, we introduce a new framework for representation
learning that we call ""Holographic Neural Architectures"" (HNAs). In the same
way that an observer can experience the 3D structure of a holographed object by
looking at its hologram from several angles, HNAs derive Holographic
Representations from the training set. These representations can then be
explored by moving along a continuous bounded single dimension. We show that
HNAs can be used to make generative networks, state-of-the-art regression
models and that they are inherently highly resistant to noise. Finally, we
argue that because of their denoising abilities and their capacity to
generalize well from very few examples, models based upon HNAs are particularly
well suited for biological applications where training examples are rare or
noisy.

"  Motivation: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are usually modelled as
networks. These networks have extensively been studied using graphlets, small
induced subgraphs capturing the local wiring patterns around nodes in networks.
They revealed that proteins involved in similar functions tend to be similarly
wired. However, such simple models can only represent pairwise relationships
and cannot fully capture the higher-order organization of protein interactions,
including protein complexes. Results: To model the multi-sale organization of
these complex biological systems, we utilize simplicial complexes from
computational geometry. The question is how to mine these new representations
of PPI networks to reveal additional biological information. To address this,
we define simplets, a generalization of graphlets to simplicial complexes. By
using simplets, we define a sensitive measure of similarity between simplicial
complex network representations that allows for clustering them according to
their data types better than clustering them by using other state-of-the-art
measures, e.g., spectral distance, or facet distribution distance. We model
human and baker's yeast PPI networks as simplicial complexes that capture PPIs
and protein complexes as simplices. On these models, we show that our newly
introduced simplet-based methods cluster proteins by function better than the
clustering methods that use the standard PPI networks, uncovering the new
underlying functional organization of the cell. We demonstrate the existence of
the functional geometry in the PPI data and the superiority of our
simplet-based methods to effectively mine for new biological information hidden
in the complexity of the higher order organization of PPI networks.
"
"  Motivated by the problem of domain formation in chromosomes, we studied a
co--polymer model where only a subset of the monomers feel attractive
interactions. These monomers are displaced randomly from a regularly-spaced
pattern, thus introducing some quenched disorder in the system. Previous work
has shown that in the case of regularly-spaced interacting monomers this chain
can fold into structures characterized by multiple distinct domains of
consecutive segments. In each domain, attractive interactions are balanced by
the entropy cost of forming loops. We show by advanced replica-exchange
simulations that adding disorder in the position of the interacting monomers
further stabilizes these domains. The model suggests that the partitioning of
the chain into well-defined domains of consecutive monomers is a spontaneous
property of heteropolymers. In the case of chromosomes, evolution could have
acted on the spacing of interacting monomers to modulate in a simple way the
underlying domains for functional reasons.
"
"  The current-voltage (I-V) conversion characterizes the physiology of cellular
microdomains and reflects cellular communication, excitability, and electrical
transduction. Yet deriving such I-V laws remains a major challenge in most
cellular microdomains due to their small sizes and the difficulty of accessing
voltage with a high nanometer precision. We present here novel analytical
relations derived for different numbers of ionic species inside a neuronal
micro/nano-domains, such as dendritic spines. When a steady-state current is
injected, we find a large deviation from the classical Ohm's law, showing that
the spine neck resistance is insuficent to characterize electrical properties.
For a constricted spine neck, modeled by a hyperboloid, we obtain a new I-V law
that illustrates the consequences of narrow passages on electrical conduction.
Finally, during a fast current transient, the local voltage is modulated by the
distance between activated voltage-gated channels. To conclude,
electro-diffusion laws can now be used to interpret voltage distribution in
neuronal microdomains.

"  Epilepsy is a neurological disorder arising from anomalies of the electrical
activity in the brain, affecting about 0.5--0.8\% of the world population.
Several studies investigated the relationship between seizures and brainwave
synchronization patterns, pursuing the possibility of identifying interictal,
preictal, ictal and postictal states. In this work, we introduce a graph-based
model of the brain interactions developed to study synchronization patterns in
the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The aim is to develop a
patient-specific approach, also for a real-time use, for the prediction of
epileptic seizures' occurrences. Different synchronization measures of the EEG
signals and easily computable functions able to capture in real-time the
variations of EEG synchronization have been considered. Both standard and
ad-hoc classification algorithms have been developed and used. Results on scalp
EEG signals show that this simple and computationally viable processing is able
to highlight the changes in the synchronization corresponding to the preictal
state.

"  The generation of anisotropic shapes occurs during morphogenesis of almost
all organisms. With the recent renewal of the interest in mechanical aspects of
morphogenesis, it has become clear that mechanics contributes to anisotropic
forms in a subtle interaction with various molecular actors. Here, we consider
plants, fungi, oomycetes, and bacteria, and we review the mechanisms by which
elongated shapes are generated and maintained. We focus on theoretical models
of the interplay between growth and mechanics, in relation with experimental
data, and discuss how models may help us improve our understanding of the
underlying biological mechanisms.

"  The replicator equation is one of the fundamental tools to study evolutionary
dynamics in well-mixed populations. This paper contributes to the literature on
evolutionary graph theory, providing a version of the replicator equation for a
family of connected networks with communities, where nodes in the same

study of different classes of games, exploring the impact of the graph
structure on the equilibria of the evolutionary dynamics.

"  Proteins are only moderately stable. It has long been debated whether this
narrow range of stabilities is solely a result of neutral drift towards lower
stability or purifying selection against excess stability is also at work - for
which no experimental evidence was found so far. Here we show that mutations
outside the active site in the essential E. coli enzyme adenylate kinase result
in stability-dependent increase in substrate inhibition by AMP, thereby
impairing overall enzyme activity at high stability. Such inhibition caused
substantial fitness defects not only in the presence of excess substrate but
also under physiological conditions. In the latter case, substrate inhibition
caused differential accumulation of AMP in the stationary phase for the
inhibition prone mutants. Further, we show that changes in flux through Adk
could accurately describe the variation in fitness effects. Taken together,
these data suggest that selection against substrate inhibition and hence excess
stability may have resulted in a narrow range of optimal stability observed for
modern proteins.

"  Multi-subject fMRI data analysis is an interesting and challenging problem in
human brain decoding studies. The inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects make it necessary to do both anatomical and
functional alignment before classification analysis. Besides, when it comes to
big data, time complexity becomes a problem that cannot be ignored. This paper
proposes Gradient Hyperalignment (Gradient-HA) as a gradient-based functional
alignment method that is suitable for multi-subject fMRI datasets with large
amounts of samples and voxels. The advantage of Gradient-HA is that it can
solve independence and high dimension problems by using Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Validation using
multi-classification tasks on big data demonstrates that Gradient-HA method has
less time complexity and better or comparable performance compared with other
state-of-the-art functional alignment methods.

"  The robustness of dynamical properties of neuronal networks against
structural damages is a central problem in computational and experimental
neuroscience. Research has shown that the cortical network of a healthy brain
works near a critical state, and moreover, that functional neuronal networks
often have scale-free and small-world properties. In this work, we study how
the robustness of simple functional networks at criticality is affected by
structural defects. In particular, we consider a 2D Ising model at the critical
temperature and investigate how its functional network changes with the
increasing degree of structural defects. We show that the scale-free and
small-world properties of the functional network at criticality are robust
against large degrees of structural lesions while the system remains below the
percolation limit. Although the Ising model is only a conceptual description of
a two-state neuron, our research reveals fundamental robustness properties of
functional networks derived from classical statistical mechanics models.

"  A tragedy of the commons (TOC) occurs when individuals acting in their own
self-interest deplete commonly-held resources, leading to a worse outcome than
had they cooperated. Over time, the depletion of resources can change
incentives for subsequent actions. Here, we investigate long-term feedback
between game and environment across a continuum of incentives in an
individual-based framework. We identify payoff-dependent transition rules that
lead to oscillatory TOC-s in stochastic simulations and the mean field limit.
Further extending the stochastic model, we find that spatially explicit
interactions can lead to emergent, localized dynamics, including the
propagation of cooperative wave fronts and cluster formation of both social
context and resources. These dynamics suggest new mechanisms underlying how
TOCs arise and how they might be averted.

"  Protein crystal production is a major bottleneck for the structural
characterisation of proteins. To advance beyond large-scale screening, rational
strategies for protein crystallization are crucial. Understanding how chemical
anisotropy (or patchiness) of the protein surface due to the variety of amino
acid side chains in contact with solvent, contributes to protein protein
contact formation in the crystal lattice is a major obstacle to predicting and
optimising crystallization. The relative scarcity of sophisticated theoretical
models that include sufficient detail to link collective behaviour, captured in
protein phase diagrams, and molecular level details, determined from
high-resolution structural information is a further barrier. Here we present
two crystals structures for the P23TR36S mutant of gamma D-crystallin, each
with opposite solubility behaviour, one melts when heated, the other when
cooled. When combined with the protein phase diagram and a tailored patchy
particle model we show that a single temperature dependent interaction is
sufficient to stabilise the inverted solubility crystal. This contact, at the
P23T substitution site, relates to a genetic cataract and reveals at a
molecular level, the origin of the lowered and retrograde solubility of the
protein. Our results show that the approach employed here may present an
alternative strategy for the rationalization of protein crystallization.

"  The new wave of successful generative models in machine learning has
increased the interest in deep learning driven de novo drug design. However,
assessing the performance of such generative models is notoriously difficult.
Metrics that are typically used to assess the performance of such generative
models are the percentage of chemically valid molecules or the similarity to
real molecules in terms of particular descriptors, such as the partition
coefficient (logP) or druglikeness. However, method comparison is difficult
because of the inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, the necessity for
multiple metrics, and the fact that some of these measures can easily be
tricked by simple rule-based systems. We propose a novel distance measure
between two sets of molecules, called Fréchet ChemNet distance (FCD), that
can be used as an evaluation metric for generative models. The FCD is similar
to a recently established performance metric for comparing image generation
methods, the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). Whereas the FID uses one of
the hidden layers of InceptionNet, the FCD utilizes the penultimate layer of a
deep neural network called ChemNet, which was trained to predict drug
activities. Thus, the FCD metric takes into account chemically and biologically
relevant information about molecules, and also measures the diversity of the
set via the distribution of generated molecules. The FCD's advantage over
previous metrics is that it can detect if generated molecules are a) diverse
and have similar b) chemical and c) biological properties as real molecules. We
further provide an easy-to-use implementation that only requires the SMILES
representation of the generated molecules as input to calculate the FCD.

"  Hydrogen bonding between nucleobases produces diverse DNA structural motifs,
including canonical duplexes, guanine (G) quadruplexes and cytosine (C)
i-motifs. Incorporating metal-mediated base pairs into nucleic acid structures
can introduce new functionalities and enhanced stabilities. Here we
demonstrate, using mass spectrometry (MS), ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), that parallel-stranded
structures consisting of up to 20 G-Ag(I)-G contiguous base pairs are formed
when natural DNA sequences are mixed with silver cations in aqueous solution.
FRET indicates that duplexes formed by poly(cytosine) strands with 20
contiguous C-Ag(I)-C base pairs are also parallel. Silver-mediated G-duplexes
form preferentially over G-quadruplexes, and the ability of Ag+ to convert
G-quadruplexes into silver-paired duplexes may provide a new route to
manipulating these biologically relevant structures. IMS indicates that
G-duplexes are linear and more rigid than B-DNA. DFT calculations were used to
propose structures compatible with the IMS experiments. Such inexpensive,
defect-free and soluble DNA-based nanowires open new directions in the design
of novel metal-mediated DNA nanotechnology.

"  Optic flow is two dimensional, but no special qualities are attached to one
or other of these dimensions. For binocular disparity, on the other hand, the
terms 'horizontal' and 'vertical' disparities are commonly used. This is odd,
since binocular disparity and optic flow describe essentially the same thing.
The difference is that, generally, people tend to fixate relatively close to
the direction of heading as they move, meaning that fixation is close to the
optic flow epipole, whereas, for binocular vision, fixation is close to the
head-centric midline, i.e. approximately 90 degrees from the binocular epipole.
For fixating animals, some separations of flow may lead to simple algorithms
for the judgement of surface structure and the control of action. We consider
the following canonical flow patterns that sum to produce overall flow: (i)
'towards' flow, the component of translational flow produced by approaching (or
retreating from) the fixated object, which produces pure radial flow on the
retina; (ii) 'sideways' flow, the remaining component of translational flow,
which is produced by translation of the optic centre orthogonal to the
cyclopean line of sight and (iii) 'vergence' flow, rotational flow produced by
a counter-rotation of the eye in order to maintain fixation. A general flow
pattern could also include (iv) 'cyclovergence' flow, produced by rotation of
one eye relative to the other about the line of sight. We consider some
practical advantages of dividing up flow in this way when an observer fixates
as they move. As in some previous treatments, we suggest that there are certain
tasks for which it is sensible to consider 'towards' flow as one component and
'sideways' + 'vergence' flow as another.

"  Neurons process information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into
spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition suppresses the output firing activity of
a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a subtractive or divisive effect
on a neuron's output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the
range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to
non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it
modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing
activity. Since these two ""modes"" of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural
coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that
distinguish these response profiles.
We use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the
specific conditions for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive
effects. We identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (IA). In our
model, this fast-activating, slowly- inactivating outward current acts as a
switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. If IA is strong (large
maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike
initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In
contrast, if IA is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has
a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical
systems methods to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic
inputs and IA.
Our findings suggest that neurons can ""self-regulate"" the gain control
effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation
of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role
for IA would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent
observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the
solitary tract.

"  Measures of neuroelectric activity from each of 18 automatically identified
white matter tracts were extracted from resting MEG recordings from a
normative, n=588, and a chronic TBI, traumatic brain injury, n=63, cohort, 60
of whose TBIs were mild. Activity in the TBI cohort was significantly reduced
compared with the norms for ten of the tracts, p < 10-6 for each. Significantly
reduced activity (p < 10-3) was seen in more than one tract in seven mTBI
individuals and one member of the normative cohort.

"  This paper is an introduction to the membrane potential equation for neurons.
Its properties are described, as well as sample applications. Networks of these
equations can be used for modeling neuronal systems, which also process images
and video sequences, respectively. Specifically, (i) a dynamic retina is
proposed (based on a reaction-diffusion system), which predicts afterimages and
simple visual illusions, (ii) a system for texture segregation (texture
elements are understood as even-symmetric contrast features), and (iii) a
network for detecting object approaches (inspired by the locust visual system).

"  In this work we study the excitatory AMPA, and NMDA, and inhibitory GABAA
receptor mediated dynamical changes in neuronal networks of neonatal rat cortex
in vitro. Extracellular network-wide activity was recorded with 59 planar
electrodes simultaneously under different pharmacological conditions. We
analyzed the changes of overall network activity and network-wide burst
frequency between baseline and AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) or NMDA receptor (NMDA-R)
driven activity, as well as between the latter states and disinhibited
activity. Additionally, spatiotemporal structures of pharmacologically modified
bursts and recruitment of electrodes during the network bursts were studied.
Our results show that AMPA-R and NMDA-R receptors have clearly distinct roles
in network dynamics. AMPA-Rs are in greater charge to initiate network wide
bursts. Therefore NMDA-Rs maintain the already initiated activity. GABAA
receptors (GABAA-Rs) inhibit AMPA-R driven network activity more strongly than
NMDA-R driven activity during the bursts.

"  Cell division site positioning is precisely regulated to generate correctly
sized and shaped daughters. We uncover a novel strategy to position the FtsZ
cytokinetic ring at midcell in the social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. PomX,
PomY and the nucleoid-binding ParA/MinD ATPase PomZ self-assemble forming a
large nucleoid-associated complex that localizes at the division site before
FtsZ to directly guide and stimulate division. PomXYZ localization is generated
through self-organized biased random motion on the nucleoid towards midcell and
constrained motion at midcell. Experiments and theory show that PomXYZ motion
is produced by diffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the complex. Flux
differences scale with the intracellular asymmetry of the complex and are
converted into a local PomZ concentration gradient across the complex with
translocation towards the higher PomZ concentration. At midcell, fluxes
equalize resulting in constrained motion. Flux-based mechanisms may represent a
general paradigm for positioning of macromolecular structures in bacteria.
"
"  Despite their significant functional roles, beta-band oscillations are least
understood. Synchronization in neuronal networks have attracted much attention
in recent years with the main focus on transition type. Whether one obtains
explosive transition or a continuous transition is an important feature of the
neuronal network which can depend on network structure as well as synaptic
types. In this study we consider the effect of synaptic interaction (electrical
and chemical) as well as structural connectivity on synchronization transition
in network models of Izhikevich neurons which spike regularly with beta
rhythms. We find a wide range of behavior including continuous transition,
explosive transition, as well as lack of global order. The stronger electrical
synapses are more conducive to synchronization and can even lead to explosive
synchronization. The key network element which determines the order of
transition is found to be the clustering coefficient and not the small world
effect, or the existence of hubs in a network. These results are in contrast to
previous results which use phase oscillator models such as the Kuramoto model.
Furthermore, we show that the patterns of synchronization changes when one goes
to the gamma band. We attribute such a change to the change in the refractory
period of Izhikevich neurons which changes significantly with frequency.

"  The purpose of this work is to construct a model for the functional
architecture of the primary visual cortex (V1), based on a structure of metric
measure space induced by the underlying organization of receptive profiles
(RPs) of visual cells. In order to account for the horizontal connectivity of
V1 in such a context, a diffusion process compatible with the geometry of the
space is defined following the classical approach of K.-T. Sturm. The
construction of our distance function does neither require any group
parameterization of the family of RPs, nor involve any differential structure.
As such, it adapts to non-parameterized sets of RPs, possibly obtained through
numerical procedures; it also allows to model the lateral connectivity arising
from non-differential metrics such as the one induced on a pinwheel surface by
a family of filters of vanishing scale. On the other hand, when applied to the
classical framework of Gabor filters, this construction yields a distance
approximating the sub-Riemannian structure proposed as a model for V1 by G.

be consistent with existing cortex models.

"  The classical idea of evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) modeling animal
behavior does not involve any spatial dependence. We considered a spatial
Hawk-Dove game played by animals in a patchy environment with wrap around
boundaries. We posit that each site contains the same number of individuals. An
evolution equation for analyzing the stability of the ESS is found as the mean
dynamics of the classical frequency dependent Moran process coupled via
migration and nonlocal payoff calculation in 1D and 2D habitats. The linear
stability analysis of the model is performed and conditions to observe spatial
patterns are investigated. For the nearest neighbor interactions (including von
Neumann and Moore neighborhoods in 2D) we concluded that it is possible to
destabilize the ESS of the game and observe pattern formation when the
dispersal rate is small enough. We numerically investigate the spatial patterns
arising from the replicator equations coupled via nearest neighbor payoff
calculation and dispersal.

"  Many of the current scientific advances in the life sciences have their
origin in the intensive use of data for knowledge discovery. In no area this is
so clear as in bioinformatics, led by technological breakthroughs in data
acquisition technologies. It has been argued that bioinformatics could quickly
become the field of research generating the largest data repositories, beating
other data-intensive areas such as high-energy physics or astroinformatics.
Over the last decade, deep learning has become a disruptive advance in machine
learning, giving new live to the long-standing connectionist paradigm in
artificial intelligence. Deep learning methods are ideally suited to
large-scale data and, therefore, they should be ideally suited to knowledge
discovery in bioinformatics and biomedicine at large. In this brief paper, we
review key aspects of the application of deep learning in bioinformatics and
medicine, drawing from the themes covered by the contributions to an ESANN 2018
special session devoted to this topic.

"  Motivation: Cellular Electron CryoTomography (CECT) is an emerging 3D imaging
technique that visualizes subcellular organization of single cells at
submolecular resolution and in near-native state. CECT captures large numbers
of macromolecular complexes of highly diverse structures and abundances.
However, the structural complexity and imaging limits complicate the systematic
de novo structural recovery and recognition of these macromolecular complexes.
Efficient and accurate reference-free subtomogram averaging and classification
represent the most critical tasks for such analysis. Existing subtomogram
alignment based methods are prone to the missing wedge effects and low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, existing maximum-likelihood based
methods rely on integration operations, which are in principle computationally
infeasible for accurate calculation.
Results: Built on existing works, we propose an integrated method, Fast
Alignment Maximum Likelihood method (FAML), which uses fast subtomogram
alignment to sample sub-optimal rigid transformations. The transformations are
then used to approximate integrals for maximum-likelihood update of subtomogram
averages through expectation-maximization algorithm. Our tests on simulated and
experimental subtomograms showed that, compared to our previously developed
fast alignment method (FA), FAML is significantly more robust to noise and
missing wedge effects with moderate increases of computation cost.Besides, FAML
performs well with significantly fewer input subtomograms when the FA method
fails. Therefore, FAML can serve as a key component for improved construction
of initial structural models from macromolecules captured by CECT.

"  Probability modelling for DNA sequence evolution is well established and
provides a rich framework for understanding genetic variation between samples
of individuals from one or more populations. We show that both classical and
more recent models for coalescence (with or without recombination) can be
described in terms of the so-called phase-type theory, where complicated and
tedious calculations are circumvented by the use of matrices. The application
of phase-type theory consists of describing the stochastic model as a Markov
model by appropriately setting up a state space and calculating the
corresponding intensity and reward matrices. Formulae of interest are then
expressed in terms of these aforementioned matrices. We illustrate this by a
few examples calculating the mean, variance and even higher order moments of
the site frequency spectrum in the multiple merger coalescent models, and by
analysing the mean and variance for the number of segregating sites for
multiple samples in the two-locus ancestral recombination graph. We believe
that phase-type theory has great potential as a tool for analysing probability
models in population genetics. The compact matrix notation is useful for
clarification of current models, in particular their formal manipulation
(calculation), but also for further development or extensions.

"  We observed the newly discovered hyperbolic minor planet 1I/`Oumuamua (2017
U1) on 2017 October 30 with Lowell Observatory's 4.3-m Discovery Channel
Telescope. From these observations, we derived a partial lightcurve with
peak-to-trough amplitude of at least 1.2 mag. This lightcurve segment rules out
rotation periods less than 3 hr and suggests that the period is at least 5 hr.
On the assumption that the variability is due to a changing cross section, the
axial ratio is at least 3:1. We saw no evidence for a coma or tail in either
individual images or in a stacked image having an equivalent exposure time of
9000 s.

"  The ability of metallic nanoparticles to supply heat to a liquid environment
under exposure to an external optical field has attracted growing interest for
biomedical applications. Controlling the thermal transport properties at a
solid-liquid interface then appears to be particularly relevant. In this work,
we address the thermal transport between water and a gold surface coated by a
polymer layer. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that
increasing the polymer density displaces the domain resisting to the heat flow,
while it doesn't affect the final amount of thermal energy released in the
liquid. This unexpected behavior results from a trade-off established by the
increasing polymer density which couples more efficiently with the solid but
initiates a counterbalancing resistance with the liquid.

"  We model large-scale ($\approx$2000km) impacts on a Mars-like planet using a
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code. The effects of material strength and of
using different Equations of State on the post-impact material and temperature
distributions are investigated. The properties of the ejected material in terms
of escaping and disc mass are analysed as well. We also study potential
numerical effects in the context of density discontinuities and rigid body
rotation. We find that in the large-scale collision regime considered here
(with impact velocities of 4km/s), the effect of material strength is
substantial for the post-impact distribution of the temperature and the
impactor material, while the influence of the Equation of State is more subtle
and present only at very high temperatures.
"
"  ""Three is a crowd"" is an old proverb that applies as much to social
interactions, as it does to frustrated configurations in statistical physics
models. Accordingly, social relations within a triangle deserve special
attention. With this motivation, we explore the impact of topological
frustration on the evolutionary dynamics of the snowdrift game on a triangular
lattice. This topology provides an irreconcilable frustration, which prevents
anti-coordination of competing strategies that would be needed for an optimal
outcome of the game. By using different strategy updating protocols, we observe
complex spatial patterns in dependence on payoff values that are reminiscent to
a honeycomb-like organization, which helps to minimize the negative consequence
of the topological frustration. We relate the emergence of these patterns to
the microscopic dynamics of the evolutionary process, both by means of
mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. For comparison, we also
consider the same evolutionary dynamics on the square lattice, where of course
the topological frustration is absent. However, with the deletion of diagonal
links of the triangular lattice, we can gradually bridge the gap to the square
lattice. Interestingly, in this case the level of cooperation in the system is
a direct indicator of the level of topological frustration, thus providing a
method to determine frustration levels in an arbitrary interaction network.

"  We study the exciton magnetic polaron (EMP) formation in (Cd,Mn)Se/(Cd,Mg)Se
diluted-magnetic-semiconductor quantum wells using time-resolved
photoluminescence (PL). The magnetic field and temperature dependencies of this
dynamics allow us to separate the non-magnetic and magnetic contributions to
the exciton localization. We deduce the EMP energy of 14 meV, which is in
agreement with time-integrated measurements based on selective excitation and
the magnetic field dependence of the PL circular polarization degree. The
polaron formation time of 500 ps is significantly longer than the corresponding
values reported earlier. We propose that this behavior is related to strong
self-localization of the EMP, accompanied with a squeezing of the heavy-hole
envelope wavefunction. This conclusion is also supported by the decrease of the
exciton lifetime from 600 ps to 200 - 400 ps with increasing magnetic field and
temperature.

"  Using low-temperature Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) we provide direct
experimental evidence for spontaneous vortex phase (SVP) formation in
EuFe$_2$(As$_{0.79}$P$_{0.21}$)$_2$ single crystal with the superconducting
$T^{\rm 0}_{\rm SC}=23.6$~K and ferromagnetic $T_{\rm FM}\sim17.7$~K transition
temperatures. Spontaneous vortex-antivortex (V-AV) pairs are imaged in the
vicinity of $T_{\rm FM}$. Also, upon cooling cycle near $T_{\rm FM}$ we observe
the first-order transition from the short period domain structure, which
appears in the Meissner state, into the long period domain structure with
spontaneous vortices. It is the first experimental observation of this scenario
in the ferromagnetic superconductors. Low-temperature phase is characterized by
much larger domains in V-AV state and peculiar branched striped structures at
the surface, which are typical for uniaxial ferromagnets with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The domain wall parameters at various temperatures
are estimated.

"  The process that leads to the formation of the bright star forming sites
observed along prominent spiral arms remains elusive. We present results of a
multi-wavelength study of a spiral arm segment in the nearby grand-design
spiral galaxy M51 that belongs to a spiral density wave and exhibits nine gas
spurs. The combined observations of the(ionized, atomic, molecular, dusty)
interstellar medium (ISM) with star formation tracers (HII regions, young
<10Myr stellar clusters) suggest (1) no variation in giant molecular cloud
(GMC) properties between arm and gas spurs, (2) gas spurs and extinction
feathers arising from the same structure with a close spatial relation between
gas spurs and ongoing/recent star formation (despite higher gas surface
densities in the spiral arm), (3) no trend in star formation age either along
the arm or along a spur, (4) evidence for strong star formation feedback in gas
spurs: (5) tentative evidence for star formation triggered by stellar feedback
for one spur, and (6) GMC associations (GMAs) being no special entities but the
result of blending of gas arm/spur cross-sections in lower resolution
observations. We conclude that there is no evidence for a coherent star
formation onset mechanism that can be solely associated to the presence of the
spiral density wave. This suggests that other (more localized) mechanisms are
important to delay star formation such that it occurs in spurs. The evidence of
star formation proceeding over several million years within individual spurs
implies that the mechanism that leads to star formation acts or is sustained
over a longer time-scale.
"
"  Assigning homogeneous boundary conditions, such as acoustic impedance, to the
thermoviscous wave equations (TWE) derived by transforming the linearized
Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) to the frequency domain yields a so-called
Helmholtz solver, whose output is a discrete set of complex eigenfunction and
eigenvalue pairs. The proposed method -- the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS) --
reverses such procedure by returning the value of acoustic impedance at one or
more unknown impedance boundaries (IBs) of a given domain via spatial
integration of the TWE for a given real-valued frequency with assigned
conditions on other boundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order
spatial discretization of the TWEs derived on an unstructured grid with
staggered grid arrangement. The momentum equation only is extended to the
center of each IB face where pressure and velocity components are co-located
and treated as unknowns. One closure condition considered for the iHS is the
assignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over the IBs,
corresponding to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the IB. The
iHS procedure is carried out independently for each frequency in order to
return the complete broadband complex impedance distribution at the IBs in any
desired frequency range. The iHS approach is first validated against Rott's
theory for both inviscid and viscous, rectangular and circular ducts. The
impedance of a geometrically complex toy cavity is then reconstructed and
verified against companion full compressible unstructured Navier-Stokes
simulations resolving the cavity geometry and one-dimensional impedance test
tube calculations based on time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC).
The iHS methodology is also shown to capture thermoacoustic effects, with
reconstructed impedance values quantitatively in agreement with thermoacoustic
growth rates.

"  Rare regions with weak disorder (Griffiths regions) have the potential to
spoil localization. We describe a non-perturbative construction of local
integrals of motion (LIOMs) for a weakly interacting spin chain in one
dimension, under a physically reasonable assumption on the statistics of
eigenvalues. We discuss ideas about the situation in higher dimensions, where
one can no longer ensure that interactions involving the Griffiths regions are
much smaller than the typical energy-level spacing for such regions. We argue
that ergodicity is restored in dimension d > 1, although equilibration should
be extremely slow, similar to the dynamics of glasses.

"  Efficient methods are proposed, for computing integrals appeaing in
electronic structure calculations. The methods consist of two parts: the first
part is to represent the integrals as contour integrals and the second one is
to evaluate the contour integrals by the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. The
efficiency of the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical
experiments.

"  We investigate the density large deviation function for a multidimensional
conservation law in the vanishing viscosity limit, when the probability
concentrates on weak solutions of a hyperbolic conservation law conservation
law. When the conductivity and dif-fusivity matrices are proportional, i.e. an
Einstein-like relation is satisfied, the problem has been solved in [4]. When
this proportionality does not hold, we compute explicitly the large deviation
function for a step-like density profile, and we show that the associated
optimal current has a non trivial structure. We also derive a lower bound for
the large deviation function, valid for a general weak solution, and leave the
general large deviation function upper bound as a conjecture.
"
"  This work discusses the numerical approximation of a nonlinear
reaction-advection-diffusion equation, which is a dimensionless form of the
Weertman equation. This equation models steadily-moving dislocations in
materials science. It reduces to the celebrated Peierls-Nabarro equation when
its advection term is set to zero. The approach rests on considering a
time-dependent formulation, which admits the equation under study as its
long-time limit. Introducing a Preconditioned Collocation Scheme based on
Fourier transforms, the iterative numerical method presented solves the
time-dependent problem, delivering at convergence the desired numerical
solution to the Weertman equation. Although it rests on an explicit
time-evolution scheme, the method allows for large time steps, and captures the
solution in a robust manner. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the
approach for several types of nonlinearities.

"  We present an investigation of the supernova remnant (SNR) G306.3$-$0.9 using
archival multi-wavelength data. The Suzaku spectra are well described by
two-component thermal plasma models: The soft component is in ionization
equilibrium and has a temperature $\sim$0.59 keV, while the hard component has
temperature $\sim$3.2 keV and ionization time-scale $\sim$$2.6\times10^{10}$
cm$^{-3}$ s. We clearly detected Fe K-shell line at energy of $\sim$6.5 keV
from this remnant. The overabundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe confirm that the
X-ray emission has an ejecta origin. The centroid energy of the Fe-K line
supports that G306.3$-$0.9 is a remnant of a Type Ia supernova (SN) rather than
a core-collapse SN. The GeV gamma-ray emission from G306.3$-$0.9 and its
surrounding were analyzed using about 6 years of Fermi data. We report about
the non-detection of G306.3$-$0.9 and the detection of a new extended gamma-ray
source in the south-west of G306.3$-$0.9 with a significance of
$\sim$13$\sigma$. We discuss several scenarios for these results with the help
of data from other wavebands to understand the SNR and its neighborhood.
"
"  Ballistic point contact (BPC) with zigzag edges in graphene is a main
candidate of a valley filter, in which the polarization of the valley degree of
freedom can be selected by using a local gate voltage. Here, we propose to
detect the valley filtering effect by Andreev reflection. Because electrons in
the lowest conduction band and the highest valence band of the BPC possess
opposite chirality, the inter-band Andreev reflection is strongly suppressed,
after multiple scattering and interference. We draw this conclusion by both the
scattering matrix analysis and the numerical simulation. The Andreev reflection
as a function of the incident energy of electrons and the local gate voltage at
the BPC is obtained, by which the parameter region for a perfect valley filter
and the direction of valley polarization can be determined. The Andreev
reflection exhibits an oscillatory decay with the length of the BPC, indicating
a negative correlation to valley polarization.
"
"  We consider multi-time correlators for output signals from linear detectors,
continuously measuring several qubit observables at the same time. Using the
quantum Bayesian formalism, we show that for unital (symmetric) evolution in
the absence of phase backaction, an $N$-time correlator can be expressed as a
product of two-time correlators when $N$ is even. For odd $N$, there is a
similar factorization, which also includes a single-time average. Theoretical
predictions agree well with experimental results for two detectors, which
simultaneously measure non-commuting qubit observables.

"  Stimuli-responsive materials that modify their shape in response to changes
in environmental conditions -- such as solute concentration, temperature, pH,
and stress -- are widespread in nature and technology. Applications include
micro- and nanoporous materials used in filtration and flow control. The
physiochemical mechanisms that induce internal volume modifications have been
widely studies. The coupling between induced volume changes and solute
transport through porous materials, however, is not well understood. Here, we
consider advective and diffusive transport through a small channel linking two
large reservoirs. A section of stimulus-responsive material regulates the
channel permeability, which is a function of the local solute concentration. We
derive an exact solution to the coupled transport problem and demonstrate the
existence of a flow regime in which the steady state is reached via a damped
oscillation around the equilibrium concentration value. Finally, the
feasibility of an experimental observation of the phenomena is discussed.
Please note that this version of the paper has not been formally peer reviewed,

"  We present muon spin rotation measurements on superconducting Cu intercalated
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, which was suggested as a realization of a topological
superconductor. We observe a clear evidence of the superconducting transition
below 4 K, where the width of magnetic field distribution increases as the
temperature is decreased. The measured broadening at mK temperatures suggests a
large London penetration depth in the $ab$ plane ($\lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim
1.6$ $\mathrm{\mu}$m). We show that the temperature dependence of this
broadening follows the BCS prediction, but could be consistent with several gap
symmetries.

"  Here we reveal details of the interaction between human lysozyme proteins,
both native and fibrils, and their water environment by intense terahertz time
domain spectroscopy. With the aid of a rigorous dielectric model, we determine
the amplitude and phase of the oscillating dipole induced by the THz field in
the volume containing the protein and its hydration water. At low
concentrations, the amplitude of this induced dipolar response decreases with
increasing concentration. Beyond a certain threshold, marking the onset of the
interactions between the extended hydration shells, the amplitude remains fixed
but the phase of the induced dipolar response, which is initially in phase with
the applied THz field, begins to change. The changes observed in the THz
response reveal protein-protein interactions me-diated by extended hydration
layers, which may control fibril formation and may have an important role in
chemical recognition phenomena.

"  We report on experimentally measured light shifts of superconducting flux
qubits deep-strongly coupled to LC oscillators, where the coupling constants
are comparable to the qubit and oscillator resonance frequencies. By using
two-tone spectroscopy, the energies of the six lowest levels of each circuit
are determined. We find huge Lamb shifts that exceed 90% of the bare qubit
frequencies and inversions of the qubits' ground and excited states when there
are a finite number of photons in the oscillator. Our experimental results
agree with theoretical predictions based on the quantum Rabi model.

"  The pyrochlore metal Cd2Re2O7 has been recently investigated by
second-harmonic generation (SHG) reflectivity. In this paper, we develop a
general formalism that allows for the identification of the relevant tensor
components of the SHG from azimuthal scans. We demonstrate that the secondary
order parameter identified by SHG at the structural phase transition is the
x2-y2 component of the axial toroidal quadrupole. This differs from the 3z2-r2
symmetry of the atomic displacements associated with the I-4m2 crystal
structure that was previously thought to be its origin. Within the same
formalism, we suggest that the primary order parameter detected in the SHG
experiment is the 3z2-r2 component of the magnetic quadrupole. We discuss the
general mechanism driving the phase transition in our proposed framework, and
suggest experiments, particularly resonant X-ray scattering ones, that could
clarify this issue.
"
"  We study the effect of domain growth on the orientation of striped phases in
a Swift-Hohenberg equation. Domain growth is encoded in a step-like parameter
dependence that allows stripe formation in a half plane, and suppresses
patterns in the complement, while the boundary of the pattern-forming region is
propagating with fixed normal velocity. We construct front solutions that leave
behind stripes in the pattern-forming region that are parallel to or at a small
oblique angle to the boundary.
Technically, the construction of stripe formation parallel to the boundary
relies on ill-posed, infinite-dimensional spatial dynamics. Stripes forming at
a small oblique angle are constructed using a functional-analytic, perturbative
approach. Here, the main difficulties are the presence of continuous spectrum
and the fact that small oblique angles appear as a singular perturbation in a
traveling-wave problem. We resolve the former difficulty using a farfield-core
decomposition and Fredholm theory in weighted spaces. The singular perturbation
problem is resolved using preconditioners and boot-strapping.

"  Analog black/white hole pairs, consisting of a region of supersonic flow,
have been achieved in a recent experiment by J. Steinhauer using an elongated
Bose-Einstein condensate. A growing standing density wave, and a checkerboard
feature in the density-density correlation function, were observed in the
supersonic region. We model the density-density correlation function, taking
into account both quantum fluctuations and the shot-to-shot variation of atom
number normally present in ultracold-atom experiments. We find that quantum
fluctuations alone produce some, but not all, of the features of the
correlation function, whereas atom-number fluctuation alone can produce all the
observed features, and agreement is best when both are included. In both cases,
the density-density correlation is not intrinsic to the fluctuations, but
rather is induced by modulation of the standing wave caused by the
fluctuations.

"  We study the evolution of spin-orbital correlations in an inhomogeneous
quantum system with an impurity replacing a doublon by a holon orbital degree
of freedom. Spin-orbital entanglement is large when spin correlations are
antiferromagnetic, while for a ferromagnetic host we obtain a pure orbital
description. In this regime the orbital model can be mapped on spinless
fermions and we uncover topological phases with zero energy modes at the edge
or at the domain between magnetically inequivalent regions.

"  The advances in geometric approaches to optical devices due to transformation
optics has led to the development of cloaks, concentrators, and other devices.
It has also been shown that transformation optics can be used to gravitational
fields from general relativity. However, the technique is currently constrained
to linear devices, as a consistent approach to nonlinearity (including both the
case of a nonlinear background medium and a nonlinear transformation) remains
an open question. Here we show that nonlinearity can be incorporated into
transformation optics in a consistent way. We use this to illustrate a number
of novel effects, including cloaking an optical soliton, modeling nonlinear
solutions to Einstein's field equations, controlling transport in a Debye
solid, and developing a set of constitutive to relations for relativistic
cloaks in arbitrary nonlinear backgrounds.

"  We investigate crack propagation in a simple two-dimensional visco-elastic
model and find a scaling regime in the relation between the propagation
velocity and energy release rate or fracture energy, together with lower and
upper bounds of the scaling regime. On the basis of our result, the existence
of the lower and upper bounds is expected to be universal or model-independent:
the present simple simulation model provides generic insight into the physics
of crack propagation, and the model will be a first step towards the
development of a more refined coarse-grained model. Relatively abrupt changes
of velocity are predicted near the lower and upper bounds for the scaling
regime and the positions of the bounds could be good markers for the
development of tough polymers, for which we provide simple views that could be
useful as guiding principles for toughening polymer-based materials.
"
"  Transistors incorporating single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the channel
material are used in a variety of electronics applications. However, a
competitive CNT-based technology requires the precise placement of CNTs at
predefined locations of a substrate. One promising placement approach is to use
chemical recognition to bind CNTs from solution at the desired locations on a
surface. Producing the chemical pattern on the substrate is challenging. Here
we describe a one-step patterning approach based on a highly photosensitive
surface monolayer. The monolayer contains chromophopric group as light
sensitive body with heteroatoms as high quantum yield photolysis center. As
deposited, the layer will bind CNTs from solution. However, when exposed to
ultraviolet (UV) light with a low dose (60 mJ/cm2) similar to that used for
conventional photoresists, the monolayer cleaves and no longer binds CNTs.
These features allow standard, wafer-scale UV lithography processes to be used
to form a patterned chemical monolayer without the need for complex substrate
patterning or monolayer stamping.
"
"  Yes, but only for a parameter value that makes it almost coincide with the
standard model. We reconsider the cosmological dynamics of a generalized
Chaplygin gas (gCg) which is split into a cold dark matter (CDM) part and a
dark energy (DE) component with constant equation of state. This model, which
implies a specific interaction between CDM and DE, has a $\Lambda$CDM limit and
provides the basis for studying deviations from the latter. Including matter
and radiation, we use the (modified) CLASS code \cite{class} to construct the
CMB and matter power spectra in order to search for a gCg-based concordance
model that is in agreement with the SNIa data from the JLA sample and with
recent Planck data. The results reveal that the gCg parameter $\alpha$ is
restricted to $|\alpha|\lesssim 0.05$, i.e., to values very close to the
$\Lambda$CDM limit $\alpha =0$. This excludes, in particular, models in which
DE decays linearly with the Hubble rate.
"
"  The interest in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as they
became reliable biomarkers for many diseases. For this reason, fast and
accurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost
importance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their
diffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA
follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement
(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\propto t$). However, we show
that NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples,
i.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour
(MSD $\propto t^\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$). To support this observation we present
a range of experimental results for both polystyrene beads and EVs. This is
also related to another problem: for the same samples there exists a huge
discrepancy (by the factor of 2-4) between the sizes measured with NTA and with
the direct imaging methods, such as AFM. This can be remedied by e.g. the
Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is
limited in the biological and poly-disperse samples. On the other hand, the
models of sub-diffusion rarely provide the direct relation between the size of
a particle and the generalized diffusion constant. However, we solve this last
problem by introducing the logarithmic model of sub-diffusion, aimed at
retrieving the size data. In result, we propose a novel protocol of NTA data
analysis. The accuracy of our method is on par with FTLA for small
($\simeq$200nm) particles. We apply our method to study the EVs samples and
corroborate the results with AFM.
"
"  We study primordial perturbations from hyperinflation, proposed recently and
based on a hyperbolic field-space. In the previous work, it was shown that the
field-space angular momentum supported by the negative curvature modifies the
background dynamics and enhances fluctuations of the scalar fields
qualitatively, assuming that the inflationary background is almost de Sitter.
In this work, we confirm and extend the analysis based on the standard approach
of cosmological perturbation in multi-field inflation. At the background level,
to quantify the deviation from de Sitter, we introduce the slow-varying
parameters and show that steep potentials, which usually can not drive
inflation, can drive inflation. At the linear perturbation level, we obtain the
power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation and express the spectral
tilt and running in terms of the slow-varying parameters. We show that
hyperinflation with power-law type potentials has already been excluded by the
recent Planck observations, while exponential-type potential with the exponent
of order unity can be made consistent with observations as far as the power
spectrum is concerned. We also argue that, in the context of a simple $D$-brane
inflation, the hyperinflation requires exponentially large hyperbolic extra
dimensions but that masses of Kaluza-Klein gravitons can be kept relatively
heavy.
"
"  Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), the most stable member of vanadium oxide family,
exhibits interesting semiconductor to metal transition in the temperature range
of 530-560 K. The metallic behavior originates because of the reduction of V2O5
through oxygen vacancies. In the present report, V2O5 nanorods in the
orthorhombic phase with crystal orientation of (001) are grown using vapor
transport process. Among three nonequivalent oxygen atoms in a VO5 pyramidal
formula unit in V2O5 structure, the role of terminal vanadyl oxygen (OI) in the
formation of metallic phase above the transition temperature is established
from the temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic studies. The origin of the
metallic behavior of V2O5 is also understood due to the breakdown of pdpi bond
between OI and nearest V atom instigated by the formation of vanadyl OI
vacancy, confirmed from the downward shift of the bottom most split-off
conduction bands in the material with increasing temperature.
"
"  We investigate the effect of dimensional crossover in the ground state of the
antiferromagnetic spin-$1$ Heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular
lattice that interpolates between the regime of weakly coupled Haldane chains
($J^{\prime}\! \!\ll\!\! J$) and the isotropic triangular lattice
($J^{\prime}\!\!=\!\!J$). We use the density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) and Schwinger boson theory performed at the Gaussian correction level
above the saddle-point solution. Our DMRG results show an abrupt transition
between decoupled spin chains and the spirally ordered regime at
$(J^{\prime}/J)_c\sim 0.42$, signaled by the sudden closing of the spin gap.
Coming from the magnetically ordered side, the computation of the spin
stiffness within Schwinger boson theory predicts the instability of the spiral
magnetic order toward a magnetically disordered phase with one-dimensional
features at $(J^{\prime}/J)_c \sim 0.43$. The agreement of these complementary
methods, along with the strong difference found between the intra- and the
interchain DMRG short spin-spin correlations; for sufficiently large values of
the interchain coupling, suggests that the interplay between the quantum
fluctuations and the dimensional crossover effects gives rise to the
one-dimensionalization phenomenon in this frustrated spin-$1$ Hamiltonian.

"  We report on a combined study of the de Haas-van Alphen effect and angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy on single crystals of the metallic
delafossite PdRhO$_2$ rounded off by \textit{ab initio} band structure
calculations. A high sensitivity torque magnetometry setup with SQUID readout
and synchrotron-based photoemission with a light spot size of
$~50\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ enabled high resolution data to be obtained from samples
as small as $150\times100\times20\,(\mu\mathrm{m})^3$. The Fermi surface shape
is nearly cylindrical with a rounded hexagonal cross section enclosing a
Luttinger volume of 1.00(1) electrons per formula unit.
"
"  Bilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures such as MoS2/WS2 and MoSe2/WSe2
have attracted much attention recently, particularly because of their type II
band alignments and the formation of interlayer exciton as the lowest-energy
excitonic state. In this work, we calculate the electronic and optical
properties of such heterostructures with the first-principles GW+Bethe-Salpeter
Equation (BSE) method and reveal the important role of interlayer coupling in
deciding the excited-state properties, including the band alignment and
excitonic properties. Our calculation shows that due to the interlayer
coupling, the low energy excitons can be widely tunable by a vertical gate
field. In particular, the dipole oscillator strength and radiative lifetime of
the lowest energy exciton in these bilayer heterostructures is varied by over
an order of magnitude within a practical external gate field. We also build a
simple model that captures the essential physics behind this tunability and
allows the extension of the ab initio results to a large range of electric
fields. Our work clarifies the physical picture of interlayer excitons in
bilayer vdW heterostructures and predicts a wide range of gate-tunable
excited-state properties of 2D optoelectronic devices.
"
"  We study the Fermi-edge singularity, describing the response of a degenerate
electron system to optical excitation, in the framework of the functional
renormalization group (fRG). Results for the (interband) particle-hole
susceptibility from various implementations of fRG (one- and two-
particle-irreducible, multi-channel Hubbard-Stratonovich, flowing
susceptibility) are compared to the summation of all leading logarithmic (log)
diagrams, achieved by a (first-order) solution of the parquet equations. For
the (zero-dimensional) special case of the X-ray-edge singularity, we show that
the leading log formula can be analytically reproduced in a consistent way from
a truncated, one-loop fRG flow. However, reviewing the underlying diagrammatic
structure, we show that this derivation relies on fortuitous partial
cancellations special to the form of and accuracy applied to the X-ray-edge
singularity and does not generalize.
"
"  We report on the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the Fe-based
superconductors (FeSCs) via application of circularly-polarized spin and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We combine this technique in
representative members of both the Fe-pnictides and Fe-chalcogenides with ab
initio density functional theory and tight-binding calculations to establish an
ubiquitous modification of the electronic structure in these materials imbued
by SOC. The influence of SOC is found to be concentrated on the hole pockets
where the superconducting gap is generally found to be largest. This result
contests descriptions of superconductivity in these materials in terms of pure
spin-singlet eigenstates, raising questions regarding the possible pairing
mechanisms and role of SOC therein.
"
"  The first transiting planetesimal orbiting a white dwarf was recently
detected in K2 data of WD1145+017 and has been followed up intensively. The
multiple, long, and variable transits suggest the transiting objects are dust
clouds, probably produced by a disintegrating asteroid. In addition, the system
contains circumstellar gas, evident by broad absorption lines, mostly in the
u'-band, and a dust disc, indicated by an infrared excess. Here we present the
first detection of a change in colour of WD1145+017 during transits, using
simultaneous multi-band fast-photometry ULTRACAM measurements over the
u'g'r'i'-bands. The observations reveal what appears to be 'bluing' during
transits; transits are deeper in the redder bands, with a u'-r' colour
difference of up to ~-0.05 mag. We explore various possible explanations for
the bluing. 'Spectral' photometry obtained by integrating over bandpasses in
the spectroscopic data in- and out-of-transit, compared to the photometric
data, shows that the observed colour difference is most likely the result of
reduced circumstellar absorption in the spectrum during transits. This
indicates that the transiting objects and the gas share the same line-of-sight,
and that the gas covers the white dwarf only partially, as would be expected if
the gas, the transiting debris, and the dust emitting the infrared excess, are
part of the same general disc structure (although possibly at different radii).
In addition, we present the results of a week-long monitoring campaign of the
system.
"
"  In this review article, we discuss recent studies on drops and bubbles in
Hele-Shaw cells, focusing on how scaling laws exhibit crossovers from the
three-dimensional counterparts and focusing on topics in which viscosity plays
an important role. By virtue of progresses in analytical theory and high-speed
imaging, dynamics of drops and bubbles have actively been studied with the aid
of scaling arguments. However, compared with three dimensional problems,
studies on the corresponding problems in Hele-Shaw cells are still limited.
This review demonstrates that the effect of confinement in the Hele-Shaw cell
introduces new physics allowing different scaling regimes to appear. For this
purpose, we discuss various examples that are potentially important for
industrial applications handling drops and bubbles in confined spaces by
showing agreement between experiments and scaling theories. As a result, this
review provides a collection of problems in hydrodynamics that may be
analytically solved or that may be worth studying numerically in the near
future.

"  In spite of Anderson's theorem, disorder is known to affect superconductivity
in conventional s-wave superconductors. In most superconductors, the degree of
disorder is fixed during sample preparation. Here we report measurements of the
superconducting properties of the two-dimensional gas that forms at the
interface between LaAlO$_3$ (LAO) and SrTiO$_3$ (STO) in the (111) crystal
orientation, a system that permits \emph{in situ} tuning of carrier density and
disorder by means of a back gate voltage $V_g$. Like the (001) oriented LAO/STO
interface, superconductivity at the (111) LAO/STO interface can be tuned by
$V_g$. In contrast to the (001) interface, superconductivity in these (111)
samples is anisotropic, being different along different interface crystal
directions, consistent with the strong anisotropy already observed other
transport properties at the (111) LAO/STO interface. In addition, we find that
the (111) interface samples ""remember"" the backgate voltage $V_F$ at which they
are cooled at temperatures near the superconducting transition temperature
$T_c$, even if $V_g$ is subsequently changed at lower temperatures. The low
energy scale and other characteristics of this memory effect ($<1$ K)
distinguish it from charge-trapping effects previously observed in (001)
interface samples.

"  We investigate beam loading and emittance preservation for a high-charge
electron beam being accelerated in quasi-linear plasma wakefields driven by a
short proton beam. The structure of the studied wakefields are similar to those
of a long, modulated proton beam, such as the AWAKE proton driver. We show that
by properly choosing the electron beam parameters and exploiting two well known
effects, beam loading of the wakefield and full blow out of plasma electrons by
the accelerated beam, the electron beam can gain large amounts of energy with a
narrow final energy spread (%-level) and without significant emittance growth.
"
"  According to astrophysical observations value of recession velocity in a
certain point is proportional to a distance to this point. The proportionality
coefficient is the Hubble constant measured with 5% accuracy. It is used in
many cosmological theories describing dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and
their relation with the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein.
In the present work we have determined a limit value of the global Hubble
constant (in a big distance from a point of observations) theoretically without
using any empirical constants on the base of our own fractal model used for the
description a relation between distance to an observed galaxy and coordinate of
its center. The distance has been defined as a nonlinear fractal measure with
scale of measurement corresponding to a deviation of the measure from its fixed
value (zero-gravity radius). We have suggested a model of specific anisotropic
fractal for simulation a radial Universe expansion. Our theoretical results
have shown existence of an inverse proportionality between accuracy of
determination the Hubble constant and accuracy of calculation a coordinates of
galaxies leading to ambiguity results obtained at cosmological observations.

"  Poynting's theorem is used to obtain an expression for the turbulent
power-spectral density as function of frequency and wavenumber in low-frequency
magnetic turbulence. No reference is made to Elsasser variables as is usually
done in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence mixing mechanical and electromagnetic
turbulence. We rather stay with an implicit form of the mechanical part of
turbulence as suggested by electromagnetic theory in arbitrary media. All of
mechanics and flows is included into a turbulent response function which by
appropriate observations can be determined from knowledge of the turbulent
fluctuation spectra. This approach is not guided by the wish of developing a
complete theory of turbulence. It aims on the identification of the response
function from observations as input into a theory which afterwards attempts its
interpretation. Combination of both the magnetic and electric power spectral
densities leads to a representation of the turbulent response function, i.e.
the turbulent conductivity spectrum $\sigma_{\omega k}$ as function of
frequency $\omega$ and wavenumber $k$. {It is given as the ratio of magnetic to
electric power spectral densities in frequency space. This knowledge allows for
formally writing down a turbulent dispersion relation. Power law inertial range
spectra result in a power law turbulent conductivity spectrum. These can be
compared with observations in the solar wind. Keywords: MHD turbulence,
turbulent dispersion relation, turbulent response function, solar wind

"  One of the most important parameters in ionospheric plasma research also
having a wide practical application in wireless satellite telecommunications is
the total electron content (TEC) representing the columnal electron number
density. The F region with high electron density provides the biggest
contribution to TEC while the relatively weakly ionized plasma of the D region
(60 km - 90 km above Earths surface) is often considered as a negligible cause
of satellite signal disturbances. However, sudden intensive ionization
processes like those induced by solar X ray flares can cause relative increases
of electron density that are significantly larger in the D-region than in
regions at higher altitudes. Therefore, one cannot exclude a priori the D
region from investigations of ionospheric influences on propagation of
electromagnetic signals emitted by satellites. We discuss here this problem
which has not been sufficiently treated in literature so far. The obtained
results are based on data collected from the D region monitoring by very low
frequency radio waves and on vertical TEC calculations from the Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal analyses, and they show noticeable
variations in the D region electron content (TECD) during activity of a solar X
ray flare (it rises by a factor of 136 in the considered case) when TECD
contribution to TEC can reach several percent and which cannot be neglected in
practical applications like global positioning procedures by satellites.
"
"  Stabilizing the magnetic signal of single adatoms is a crucial step towards
their successful usage in widespread technological applications such as
high-density magnetic data storage devices. The quantum mechanical nature of
these tiny objects, however, introduces intrinsic zero-point spin-fluctuations
that tend to destabilize the local magnetic moment of interest by dwindling the
magnetic anisotropy potential barrier even at absolute zero temperature. Here,
we elucidate the origins and quantify the effect of the fundamental ingredients
determining the magnitude of the fluctuations, namely the ($i$) local magnetic
moment, ($ii$) spin-orbit coupling and ($iii$) electron-hole Stoner
excitations. Based on a systematic first-principles study of 3d and 4d adatoms,
we demonstrate that the transverse contribution of the fluctuations is
comparable in size to the magnetic moment itself, leading to a remarkable
$\gtrsim$50$\%$ reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy. Our analysis gives
rise to a comprehensible diagram relating the fluctuation magnitude to
characteristic features of adatoms, providing practical guidelines for
designing magnetically stable nanomagnets with minimal quantum fluctuations.
"
"  We develope a two-species exclusion process with a distinct pair of entry and
exit sites for each species of rigid rods. The relatively slower forward
stepping of the rods in an extended bottleneck region, located in between the
two entry sites, controls the extent of interference of the co-directional flow
of the two species of rods. The relative positions of the sites of entry of the
two species of rods with respect to the location of the bottleneck are
motivated by a biological phenomenon. However, the primary focus of the study
here is to explore the effects of the interference of the flow of the two
species of rods on their spatio-temporal organization and the regulations of
this interference by the extended bottleneck. By a combination of mean-field
theory and computer simulation we calculate the flux of both species of rods
and their density profiles as well as the composite phase diagrams of the
system. If the bottleneck is sufficiently stringent some of the phases become
practically unrealizable although not ruled out on the basis of any fundamental
physical principle. Moreover the extent of suppression of flow of the
downstream entrants by the flow of the upstream entrants can also be regulated
by the strength of the bottleneck. We speculate on the possible implications of
the results in the context of the biological phenomenon that motivated the
formulation of the theoretical model.
"
"  We explicitly compute the critical exponents associated with logarithmic
corrections (the so-called hatted exponents) starting from the renormalization
group equations and the mean field behavior for a wide class of models at the
upper critical behavior (for short and long range $\phi^n$-theories) and below
it. This allows us to check the scaling relations among these critical
exponents obtained by analysing the complex singularities (Lee-Yang and Fisher
zeroes) of these models. Moreover, we have obtained an explicit method to
compute the $\hat{\coppa}$ exponent [defined by $\xi\sim L (\log
L)^{\hat{\coppa}}$] and, finally, we have found a new derivation of the scaling
law associated with it.

"  The temperature-dependent evolution of the Kondo lattice is a long-standing
topic of theoretical and experimental investigation and yet it lacks a truly
microscopic description of the relation of the basic $f$-$d$ hybridization
processes to the fundamental temperature scales of Kondo screening and
Fermi-liquid lattice coherence. Here, the temperature-dependence of $f$-$d$
hybridized band dispersions and Fermi-energy $f$ spectral weight in the Kondo
lattice system CeCoIn$_5$ is investigated using $f$-resonant angle-resolved
photoemission (ARPES) with sufficient detail to allow direct comparison to
first principles dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations containing
full realism of crystalline electric field states. The ARPES results, for two
orthogonal (001) and (100) cleaved surfaces and three different $f$-$d$
hybridization scenarios, with additional microscopic insight provided by DMFT,
reveal $f$ participation in the Fermi surface at temperatures much higher than
the lattice coherence temperature, $T^*\approx$ 45 K, commonly believed to be
the onset for such behavior. The identification of a $T$-dependent crystalline
electric field degeneracy crossover in the DMFT theory $below$ $T^*$ is
specifically highlighted.
"
"  The apparent gas permeability of the porous medium is an important parameter
in the prediction of unconventional gas production, which was first
investigated systematically by Klinkenberg in 1941 and found to increase with
the reciprocal mean gas pressure (or equivalently, the Knudsen number).
Although the underlying rarefaction effects are well-known, the reason that the
correction factor in Klinkenberg's famous equation decreases when the Knudsen
number increases has not been fully understood. Most of the studies idealize
the porous medium as a bundle of straight cylindrical tubes, however, according
to the gas kinetic theory, this only results in an increase of the correction
factor with the Knudsen number, which clearly contradicts Klinkenberg's
experimental observations. Here, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation
in simplified (but not simple) porous media, we identify, for the first time,
two key factors that can explain Klinkenberg's experimental results: the
tortuous flow path and the non-unitary tangential momentum accommodation
coefficient for the gas-surface interaction. Moreover, we find that
Klinkenberg's results can only be observed when the ratio between the apparent
and intrinsic permeabilities is $\lesssim30$; at large ratios (or Knudsen
numbers) the correction factor increases with the Knudsen number. Our numerical
results could also serve as benchmarking cases to assess the accuracy of
macroscopic models and/or numerical schemes for the modeling/simulation of
rarefied gas flows in complex geometries over a wide range of gas rarefaction.

"  We explore the topological properties of quantum spin-1/2 chains with two
Ising symmetries. This class of models does not possess any of the symmetries
that are required to protect the Haldane phase. Nevertheless, we show that
there are 4 symmetry-protected topological phases, in addition to 6 phases that
spontaneously break one or both Ising symmetries. By mapping the model to
one-dimensional interacting fermions with particle-hole and time-reversal
symmetry, we obtain integrable parent Hamiltonians for the conventional and
topological phases of the spin model. We use these Hamiltonians to characterize
the physical properties of all 10 phases, identify their local and nonlocal
order parameters, and understand the effects of weak perturbations that respect
the Ising symmetries. Our study provides the first explicit example of a class
of spin chains with several topologically non-trivial phases, and binds
together the topological classifications of interacting bosons and fermions.

"  Ensemble data assimilation methods such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)
are a key component of probabilistic weather forecasting. They represent the
uncertainty in the initial conditions by an ensemble which incorporates
information coming from the physical model with the latest observations.
High-resolution numerical weather prediction models ran at operational centers
are able to resolve non-linear and non-Gaussian physical phenomena such as
convection. There is therefore a growing need to develop ensemble assimilation
algorithms able to deal with non-Gaussianity while staying computationally
feasible. In the present paper we address some of these needs by proposing a
new hybrid algorithm based on the Ensemble Kalman Particle Filter. It is fully
formulated in ensemble space and uses a deterministic scheme such that it has
the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) instead of the stochastic EnKF as a
limiting case. A new criterion for choosing the proportion of particle filter
and ETKF update is also proposed. The new algorithm is implemented in the COSMO
framework and numerical experiments in a quasi-operational convective-scale
setup are conducted. The results show the feasibility of the new algorithm in
practice and indicate a strong potential for such local hybrid methods, in
particular for forecasting non-Gaussian variables such as wind and hourly
precipitation.

"  Galaxies in the local Universe are known to follow bimodal distributions in
the global stellar populations properties. We analyze the distribution of the
local average stellar-population ages of 654,053 sub-galactic regions resolved
on ~1-kpc scales in a volume-corrected sample of 394 galaxies, drawn from the
CALIFA-DR3 integral-field-spectroscopy survey and complemented by SDSS imaging.
We find a bimodal local-age distribution, with an old and a young peak
primarily due to regions in early-type galaxies and star-forming regions of
spirals, respectively. Within spiral galaxies, the older ages of bulges and
inter-arm regions relative to spiral arms support an internal age bimodality.
Although regions of higher stellar-mass surface-density, mu*, are typically
older, mu* alone does not determine the stellar population age and a bimodal
distribution is found at any fixed mu*. We identify an ""old ridge"" of regions
of age ~9 Gyr, independent of mu*, and a ""young sequence"" of regions with age
increasing with mu* from 1-1.5 Gyr to 4-5 Gyr. We interpret the former as
regions containing only old stars, and the latter as regions where the relative
contamination of old stellar populations by young stars decreases as mu*
increases. The reason why this bimodal age distribution is not inconsistent
with the unimodal shape of the cosmic-averaged star-formation history is that
i) the dominating contribution by young stars biases the age low with respect
to the average epoch of star formation, and ii) the use of a single average age
per region is unable to represent the full time-extent of the star-formation
history of ""young-sequence"" regions.

"  We introduce a minimal model for the evolution of functional
protein-interaction networks using a sequence-based mutational algorithm, and
apply the model to study neutral drift in networks that yield oscillatory
dynamics. Starting with a functional core module, random evolutionary drift
increases network complexity even in the absence of specific selective
pressures. Surprisingly, we uncover a hidden order in sequence space that gives
rise to long-term evolutionary memory, implying strong constraints on network
evolution due to the topology of accessible sequence space.
"
"  We construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory for relativistic
hydrodynamics for charged matter in a thermal background using a superspace
formalism. Superspace allows us to efficiently impose the symmetries of the
problem and to obtain a simple expression for the effective action. We show
that the theory we obtain is compatible with the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger
condition, which in turn implies that Green's functions obey the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our approach complements and extends existing
formulations found in the literature.

"  Observables have a dual nature in both classical and quantum kinematics: they
are at the same time \emph{quantities}, allowing to separate states by means of
their numerical values, and \emph{generators of transformations}, establishing
relations between different states. In this work, we show how this two-fold
role of observables constitutes a key feature in the conceptual analysis of
classical and quantum kinematics, shedding a new light on the distinguishing
feature of the quantum at the kinematical level. We first take a look at the
algebraic description of both classical and quantum observables in terms of
Jordan-Lie algebras and show how the two algebraic structures are the precise
mathematical manifestation of the two-fold role of observables. Then, we turn
to the geometric reformulation of quantum kinematics in terms of Kähler
manifolds. A key achievement of this reformulation is to show that the two-fold
role of observables is the constitutive ingredient defining what an observable
is. Moreover, it points to the fact that, from the restricted point of view of
the transformational role of observables, classical and quantum kinematics
behave in exactly the same way. Finally, we present Landsman's general
framework of Poisson spaces with transition probability, which highlights with
unmatched clarity that the crucial difference between the two kinematics lies
in the way the two roles of observables are related to each other.
"
"  The calculation of minimum energy paths for transitions such as atomic and/or
spin re-arrangements is an important task in many contexts and can often be
used to determine the mechanism and rate of transitions. An important challenge
is to reduce the computational effort in such calculations, especially when ab
initio or electron density functional calculations are used to evaluate the
energy since they can require large computational effort. Gaussian process
regression is used here to reduce significantly the number of energy
evaluations needed to find minimum energy paths of atomic rearrangements. By
using results of previous calculations to construct an approximate energy
surface and then converge to the minimum energy path on that surface in each
Gaussian process iteration, the number of energy evaluations is reduced
significantly as compared with regular nudged elastic band calculations. For a
test problem involving rearrangements of a heptamer island on a crystal
surface, the number of energy evaluations is reduced to less than a fifth. The
scaling of the computational effort with the number of degrees of freedom as
well as various possible further improvements to this approach are discussed.

"  We implement an efficient numerical method to calculate response functions of
complex impurities based on the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and
use it as the impurity-solver of the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). This
method uses the correction vector to obtain precise Green's functions on the
real frequency axis at zero temperature. By using a self-consistent bath
configuration with very low entanglement, we take full advantage of the DMRG to
calculate dynamical response functions paving the way to treat large effective
impurities such as those corresponding to multi-orbital interacting models and
multi-site or multi-momenta clusters. This method leads to reliable
calculations of non-local self energies at arbitrary dopings and interactions
and at any energy scale.

"  Bulk and surface electronic structures, calculated using density functional
theory and a tight-binding model Hamiltonian, reveal the existence of two
topologically invariant (TI) surface states in the family of cubic Bi
perovskites (ABiO$_3$; A = Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba). The two TI
states, one lying in the valence band (TI-V) and other lying in the conduction
band (TI-C) are formed out of bonding and antibonding states of the
Bi-$\{$s,p$\}$ - O-$\{$p$\}$ coordinated covalent interaction. Below a certain
critical thickness of the film, which varies with A, TI states of top and
bottom surfaces couple to destroy the Dirac type linear dispersion and
consequently to open surface energy gaps. The origin of s-p band inversion,
necessary to form a TI state, classifies the family of ABiO$_3$ into two. For
class-I (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs and Mg) the band inversion, leading to TI-C state,
is induced by spin-orbit coupling of the Bi-p states and for class-II (A = Ca,
Sr and Ba) the band inversion is induced through weak but sensitive second
neighbor Bi-Bi interactions.

"  We study the band structure topology and engineering from the interplay
between local moments and itinerant electrons in the context of pyrochlore
iridates. For the metallic iridate Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, the Ir $5d$ conduction
electrons interact with the Pr $4f$ local moments via the $f$-$d$ exchange.
While the Ir electrons form a Luttinger semimetal, the Pr moments can be tuned
into an ordered spin ice with a finite ordering wavevector, dubbed
""Melko-Hertog-Gingras"" state, by varying Ir and O contents. We point out that
the ordered spin ice of the Pr local moments generates an internal magnetic
field that reconstructs the band structure of the Luttinger semimetal. Besides
the broad existence of Weyl nodes, we predict that the magnetic translation of
the ""Melko-Hertog-Gingras"" state for the Pr moments protects the Dirac band
touching at certain time reversal invariant momenta for the Ir conduction
electrons. We propose the magnetic fields to control the Pr magnetic structure
and thereby indirectly influence the topological and other properties of the Ir
electrons. Our prediction may be immediately tested in the ordered
Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ samples. We expect our work to stimulate a detailed
examination of the band structure, magneto-transport, and other properties of
Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$.

"  The topological morphology--order of zeros at the positions of electrons with
respect to a specific electron--of Laughlin state at filling fractions $1/m$
($m$ odd) is homogeneous as every electron feels zeros of order $m$ at the
positions of other electrons. Although fairly accurate ground state wave
functions for most of the other quantum Hall states in the lowest Landau level
are quite well-known, it had been an open problem in expressing the ground
state wave functions in terms of flux-attachment to particles, {\em a la}, this
morphology of Laughlin state. With a very general consideration of
flux-particle relations only, in spherical geometry, we here report a novel
method for determining morphologies of these states. Based on these, we
construct almost exact ground state wave-functions for the Coulomb interaction.
Although the form of interaction may change the ground state wave-function, the
same morphology constructs the latter irrespective of the nature of the
interaction between electrons.

"  The regularity of earthquakes, their destructive power, and the nuisance of
ground vibration in urban environments, all motivate designs of defence
structures to lessen the impact of seismic and ground vibration waves on
buildings. Low frequency waves, in the range $1$ to $10$ Hz for earthquakes and
up to a few tens of Hz for vibrations generated by human activities, cause a
large amount of damage, or inconvenience, depending on the geological
conditions they can travel considerable distances and may match the resonant
fundamental frequency of buildings. The ultimate aim of any seismic
metamaterial, or any other seismic shield, is to protect over this entire range
of frequencies, the long wavelengths involved, and low frequency, have meant
this has been unachievable to date.
Elastic flexural waves, applicable in the mechanical vibrations of thin
elastic plates, can be designed to have a broad zero-frequency stop-band using
a periodic array of very small clamped circles. Inspired by this experimental
and theoretical observation, all be it in a situation far removed from seismic
waves, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve elastic surface (Rayleigh)
and body (pressure P and shear S) wave reflectors at very large wavelengths in
structured soils modelled as a fully elastic layer periodically clamped to
bedrock.
We identify zero frequency stop-bands that only exist in the limit of columns
of concrete clamped at their base to the bedrock. In a realistic configuration
of a sedimentary basin 15 meters deep we observe a zero frequency stop-band
covering a broad frequency range of $0$ to $30$ Hz.

"  A ROSAT survey of the Alpha Per open cluster in 1993 detected its brightest
star, mid-F supergiant Alpha Persei: the X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness
were similar to coronally active late-type dwarf members. Later, in 2010, a
Hubble Cosmic Origins Spectrograph SNAPshot of Alpha Persei found
far-ultraviolet coronal proxy SiIV unexpectedly weak. This, and a suspicious
offset of the ROSAT source, suggested that a late-type companion might be
responsible for the X-rays. Recently, a multi-faceted program tested that
premise. Groundbased optical coronography, and near-UV imaging with HST Wide
Field Camera 3, searched for any close-in faint candidate coronal objects, but
without success. Then, a Chandra pointing found the X-ray source single and
coincident with the bright star. Significantly, the SiIV emissions of Alpha
Persei, in a deeper FUV spectrum collected by HST COS as part of the joint
program, aligned well with chromospheric atomic oxygen (which must be intrinsic
to the luminous star), within the context of cooler late-F and early-G
supergiants, including Cepheid variables. This pointed to the X-rays as the
fundamental anomaly. The over-luminous X-rays still support the case for a
hyperactive dwarf secondary, albeit now spatially unresolved. However, an
alternative is that Alpha Persei represents a novel class of coronal source.
Resolving the first possibility now has become more difficult, because the easy
solution -- a well separated companion -- has been eliminated. Testing the
other possibility will require a broader high-energy census of the early-F
supergiants.

"  Young asteroid families are unique sources of information about fragmentation
physics and the structure of their parent bodies, since their physical
properties have not changed much since their birth. Families have different
properties such as age, size, taxonomy, collision severity and others, and
understanding the effect of those properties on our observations of the
size-frequency distribution (SFD) of family fragments can give us important
insights into the hypervelocity collision processes at scales we cannot achieve
in our laboratories. Here we take as an example the very young Datura family,
with a small 8-km parent body, and compare its size distribution to other
families, with both large and small parent bodies, and created by both
catastrophic and cratering formation events. We conclude that most likely
explanation for the shallower size distribution compared to larger families is
a more pronounced observational bias because of its small size. Its size
distribution is perfectly normal when its parent body size is taken into
account. We also discuss some other possibilities. In addition, we study
another common feature: an offset or ""bump"" in the distribution occurring for a
few of the larger elements. We hypothesize that it can be explained by a newly
described regime of cratering, ""spall cratering"", which controls the majority
of impact craters on the surface of small asteroids like Datura.
"
"  Tomography has made a radical impact on diverse fields ranging from the study
of 3D atomic arrangements in matter to the study of human health in medicine.
Despite its very diverse applications, the core of tomography remains the same,
that is, a mathematical method must be implemented to reconstruct the 3D
structure of an object from a number of 2D projections. In many scientific
applications, however, the number of projections that can be measured is
limited due to geometric constraints, tolerable radiation dose and/or
acquisition speed. Thus it becomes an important problem to obtain the
best-possible reconstruction from a limited number of projections. Here, we
present the mathematical implementation of a tomographic algorithm, termed
GENeralized Fourier Iterative REconstruction (GENFIRE). By iterating between
real and reciprocal space, GENFIRE searches for a global solution that is
concurrently consistent with the measured data and general physical
constraints. The algorithm requires minimal human intervention and also
incorporates angular refinement to reduce the tilt angle error. We demonstrate
that GENFIRE can produce superior results relative to several other popular
tomographic reconstruction techniques by numerical simulations, and by
experimentally by reconstructing the 3D structure of a porous material and a
frozen-hydrated marine cyanobacterium. Equipped with a graphical user
interface, GENFIRE is freely available from our website and is expected to find
broad applications across different disciplines.

"  Based on optical high-resolution spectra obtained with CFHT/ESPaDOnS, we
present new measurements of activity and magnetic field proxies of 442 low-mass
K5-M7 dwarfs. The objects were analysed as potential targets to search for
planetary-mass companions with the new spectropolarimeter and high-precision
velocimeter, SPIRou. We have analysed their high-resolution spectra in an
homogeneous way: circular polarisation, chromospheric features, and Zeeman
broadening of the FeH infrared line. The complex relationship between these
activity indicators is analysed: while no strong connection is found between
the large-scale and small-scale magnetic fields, the latter relates with the
non-thermal flux originating in the chromosphere.
We then examine the relationship between various activity diagnostics and the
optical radial-velocity jitter available in the literature, especially for
planet host stars. We use this to derive for all stars an activity merit
function (higher for quieter stars) with the goal of identifying the most
favorable stars where the radial-velocity jitter is low enough for planet
searches. We find that the main contributors to the RV jitter are the
large-scale magnetic field and the chromospheric non-thermal emission.
In addition, three stars (GJ 1289, GJ 793, and GJ 251) have been followed
along their rotation using the spectropolarimetric mode, and we derive their
magnetic topology. These very slow rotators are good representatives of future
SPIRou targets. They are compared to other stars where the magnetic topology is
also known. The poloidal component of the magnetic field is predominent in all
three stars.
"
"  When a two-dimensional electron gas is exposed to a perpendicular magnetic
field and an in-plane electric field, its conductance becomes quantized in the
transverse in-plane direction: this is known as the quantum Hall (QH) effect.
This effect is a result of the nontrivial topology of the system's electronic
band structure, where an integer topological invariant known as the first Chern
number leads to the quantization of the Hall conductance. Interestingly, it was
shown that the QH effect can be generalized mathematically to four spatial
dimensions (4D), but this effect has never been realized for the obvious reason
that experimental systems are bound to three spatial dimensions. In this work,
we harness the high tunability and control offered by photonic waveguide arrays
to experimentally realize a dynamically-generated 4D QH system using a 2D array
of coupled optical waveguides. The inter-waveguide separation is constructed
such that the propagation of light along the device samples over
higher-dimensional momenta in the directions orthogonal to the two physical
dimensions, thus realizing a 2D topological pump. As a result, the device's
band structure is associated with 4D topological invariants known as second
Chern numbers which support a quantized bulk Hall response with a 4D symmetry.
In a finite-sized system, the 4D topological bulk response is carried by
localized edges modes that cross the sample as a function of of the modulated
auxiliary momenta. We directly observe this crossing through photon pumping
from edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner of our system. These are equivalent to
the pumping of charge across a 4D system from one 3D hypersurface to the
opposite one and from one 2D hyperedge to another, and serve as first
experimental realization of higher-dimensional topological physics.

"  The crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity to
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is difficult to realize in quantum materials
because, unlike in ultracold atoms, one cannot tune the pairing interaction. We
realize the BCS-BEC crossover in a nearly compensated semimetal
Fe$_{1+y}$Se$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ by tuning the Fermi energy, $\epsilon_F$, via
chemical doping, which permits us to systematically change $\Delta /
\epsilon_F$ from 0.16 to 0.5 were $\Delta$ is the superconducting (SC) gap. We
use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the Fermi energy, the
SC gap and characteristic changes in the SC state electronic dispersion as the
system evolves from a BCS to a BEC regime. Our results raise important
questions about the crossover in multiband superconductors which go beyond
those addressed in the context of cold atoms.

"  200 nm thick SiO2 layers grown on Si substrates and Ge ions of 150 keV energy
were implanted into SiO2 matrix with Different fluences. The implanted samples
were annealed at 950 C for 30 minutes in Ar ambience. Topographical studies of
implanted as well as annealed samples were captured by the atomic force
microscopy (AFM). Two dimension (2D) multifractal detrended fluctuation
analysis (MFDFA) based on the partition function approach has been used to
study the surfaces of ion implanted and annealed samples. The partition
function is used to calculate generalized Hurst exponent with the segment size.
Moreover, it is seen that the generalized Hurst exponents vary nonlinearly with
the moment, thereby exhibiting the multifractal nature. The multifractality of
surface is pronounced after annealing for the surface implanted with fluence
7.5X1016 ions/cm^2.

"  Corrosion of Indian RAFMS (reduced activation ferritic martensitic steel)
material with liquid metal, Lead Lithium ( Pb-Li) has been studied under static
condition, maintaining Pb-Li at 550 C for different time durations, 2500, 5000
and 9000 hours. Corrosion rate was calculated from weight loss measurements.
Microstructure analysis was carried out using SEM and chemical composition by
SEM-EDX measurements. Micro Vickers hardness and tensile testing were also
carried out. Chromium was found leaching from the near surface regions and
surface hardness was found to decrease in all the three cases. Grain boundaries
were affected. Some grains got detached from the surface giving rise to pebble
like structures in the surface micrographs. There was no significant reduction
in the tensile strength, after exposure to liquid metal. This paper discusses
the experimental details and the results obtained.

"  This paper presents an overview and discussion of magnetocapillary
self-assemblies. New results are presented, in particular concerning the
possible development of future applications. These self-organizing structures
possess the notable ability to move along an interface when powered by an
oscillatory, uniform magnetic field. The system is constructed as follows. Soft
magnetic particles are placed on a liquid interface, and submitted to a
magnetic induction field. An attractive force due to the curvature of the
interface around the particles competes with an interaction between magnetic
dipoles. Ordered structures can spontaneously emerge from these conditions.
Furthermore, time-dependent magnetic fields can produce a wide range of dynamic
behaviours, including non-time-reversible deformation sequences that produce
translational motion at low Reynolds number. In other words, due to a
spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry, the assembly can turn into a
surface microswimmer. Trajectories have been shown to be precisely
controllable. As a consequence, this system offers a way to produce microrobots
able to perform different tasks. This is illustrated in this paper by the
capture, transport and release of a floating cargo, and the controlled mixing
of fluids at low Reynolds number.
"
"  In glass forming liquids close to the glass transition point, even a very
slight increase in the macroscopic density results in a dramatic slowing down
of the macroscopic relaxation. Concomitantly, the local density itself
fluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local
density variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective,
a model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is
introduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a
certain threshold value, $\rho_{\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle
rearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period
($\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy
cluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict
that with compression (increasing average density $\rho$) at a fixed
temperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the
clusters, $\xi$, diverges as $\xi\sim(\rho_{\rm c}-\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is
the spatial dimensionality. This $\xi$ measures the average persistence length
of the steric constraints in blocking the rearrangement motions and is
determined by the subsystem density. Additionally, with decreasing $T$ at a
fixed $\rho$, the length scale diverges in the same manner as $\xi\sim(T-T_{\rm
c})^{-2/d}$, for which $\rho$ is identical to $\rho_{\rm c}$ at $T=T_{\rm c}$.
The exponent describing the diverging length scale is the same as the one
predicted by some theoretical models and indeed has been observed in some
simulations and experiments. However, the basic mechanism for this divergence
is different; that is, we do not invoke thermodynamic anomalies associated with
the thermodynamic phase transition as the origin of the growing length scale.
We further present arguements for the cooperative properties based on the
clusters.
"
"  The unusually high surface tension of room temperature liquid metal is
molding it as unique material for diverse newly emerging areas. However, unlike
its practices on earth, such metal fluid would display very different behaviors
when working in space where gravity disappears and surface property dominates
the major physics. So far, few direct evidences are available to understand
such effect which would impede further exploration of liquid metal use for
space. Here to preliminarily probe into this intriguing issue, a low cost
experimental strategy to simulate microgravity environment on earth was
proposed through adopting bridges with high enough free falling distance as the
test platform. Then using digital cameras amounted along x, y, z directions on
outside wall of the transparent container with liquid metal and allied solution
inside, synchronous observations on the transient flow and transformational
activities of liquid metal were performed. Meanwhile, an unmanned aerial
vehicle was adopted to record the whole free falling dynamics of the test
capsule from the far end which can help justify subsequent experimental
procedures. A series of typical fundamental phenomena were thus observed as:
(a) A relatively large liquid metal object would spontaneously transform from
its original planar pool state into a sphere and float in the container if
initiating the free falling; (b) The liquid metal changes its three-dimensional
shape due to dynamic microgravity strength due to free falling and rebound of
the test capsule; and (c) A quick spatial transformation of liquid metal
immersed in the solution can easily be induced via external electrical fields.
The mechanisms of the surface tension driven liquid metal actuation in space
were interpreted. All these findings indicated that microgravity effect should
be fully treated in developing future generation liquid metal space
technologies.

"  We experimentally confirmed the threshold behavior and scattering length
scaling law of the three-body loss coefficients in an ultracold spin-polarized
gas of $^6$Li atoms near a $p$-wave Feshbach resonance. We measured the
three-body loss coefficients as functions of temperature and scattering volume,
and found that the threshold law and the scattering length scaling law hold in
limited temperature and magnetic field regions. We also found that the
breakdown of the scaling laws is due to the emergence of the effective-range
term. This work is an important first step toward full understanding of the
loss of identical fermions with $p$-wave interactions.

"  Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a novel imaging modality with important
applications such as angiography, stem cell tracking, and cancer imaging.
Recently, there have been efforts to increase the functionality of MPI via
multi-color imaging methods that can distinguish the responses of different
nanoparticles, or nanoparticles in different environmental conditions. The
proposed techniques typically rely on extensive calibrations that capture the
differences in the harmonic responses of the nanoparticles. In this work, we
propose a method to directly estimate the relaxation time constant of the
nanoparticles from the MPI signal, which is then used to generate a multi-color
relaxation map. The technique is based on the underlying mirror symmetry of the
adiabatic MPI signal when the same region is scanned back and forth. We
validate the proposed method via extensive simulations, and via experiments on
our in-house Magnetic Particle Spectrometer (MPS) setup at 550 Hz and our
in-house MPI scanner at 9.7 kHz. Our results show that nanoparticles can be
successfully distinguished with the proposed technique, without any calibration
or prior knowledge about the nanoparticles.

"  Cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are formed by scattering of
X-ray photons off quantized plasma electrons in the strong magnetic field (of
the order 10^12 G) close to the surface of an accreting X-ray pulsar. The line
profiles of CRSFs cannot be described by an analytic expression. Numerical
methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the scattering processes are
required in order to predict precise line shapes for a given physical setup,
which can be compared to observations to gain information about the underlying
physics in these systems.
A versatile simulation code is needed for the generation of synthetic
cyclotron lines. Sophisticated geometries should be investigatable by making
their simulation possible for the first time.
The simulation utilizes the mean free path tables described in the first
paper of this series for the fast interpolation of propagation lengths. The
code is parallelized to make the very time consuming simulations possible on
convenient time scales. Furthermore, it can generate responses to
mono-energetic photon injections, producing Green's functions, which can be
used later to generate spectra for arbitrary continua.
We develop a new simulation code to generate synthetic cyclotron lines for
complex scenarios, allowing for unprecedented physical interpretation of the
observed data. An associated XSPEC model implementation is used to fit
synthetic line profiles to NuSTAR data of Cep X-4. The code has been developed
with the main goal of overcoming previous geometrical constraints in MC
simulations of CRSFs. By applying this code also to more simple, classic
geometries used in previous works, we furthermore address issues of code
verification and cross-comparison of various models. The XSPEC model and the
Green's function tables are available online at
this http URL .

"  Recently, we have predicted that the modulation instability of optical vortex
solitons propagating in nonlinear colloidal suspensions with exponential
saturable nonlinearity leads to formation of necklace beams (NBs)
[S.~Z.~Silahli, W.~Walasik and N.~M.~Litchinitser, Opt.~Lett., \textbf{40},
5714 (2015)]. Here, we investigate the dynamics of NB formation and
propagation, and show that the distance at which the NB is formed depends on
the input power of the vortex beam. Moreover, we show that the NB trajectories
are not necessarily tangent to the initial vortex ring, and that their
velocities have components stemming both from the beam diffraction and from the
beam orbital angular momentum. We also demonstrate the generation of twisted
solitons and analyze the influence of losses on their propagation. Finally, we
investigate the conservation of the orbital angular momentum in necklace and
twisted beams. Our studies, performed in ideal lossless media and in realistic
colloidal suspensions with losses, provide a detailed description of NB
dynamics and may be useful in studies of light propagation in highly scattering
colloids and biological samples.

"  A three-dimensional spin current solver based on a generalised spin
drift-diffusion description, including the spin Hall effect, is integrated with
a magnetisation dynamics solver. The resulting model is shown to simultaneously
reproduce the spin-orbit torques generated using the spin Hall effect, spin
pumping torques generated by magnetisation dynamics in multilayers, as well as
the spin transfer torques acting on magnetisation regions with spatial
gradients, whilst field-like and spin-like torques are reproduced in a spin
valve geometry. Two approaches to modelling interfaces are analysed, one based
on the spin mixing conductance and the other based on continuity of spin
currents where the spin dephasing length governs the absorption of transverse
spin components. In both cases analytical formulas are derived for the
spin-orbit torques in a heavy metal / ferromagnet bilayer geometry, showing in
general both field-like and damping-like torques are generated. The limitations
of the analytical approach are discussed, showing that even in a simple bilayer
geometry, due to the non-uniformity of the spin currents, a full
three-dimensional treatment is required. Finally the model is applied to the
quantitative analysis of the spin Hall angle in Pt by reproducing published
experimental data on the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth in the bilayer
geometry.

"  Immiscible fluids flowing at high capillary numbers in porous media may be
characterized by an effective viscosity. We demonstrate that the effective
viscosity is well described by the Lichtenecker-Rother equation. The exponent
$\alpha$ in this equation takes either the value 1 or 0.6 in two- and 0.5 in
three-dimensional systems depending on the pore geometry. Our arguments are
based on analytical and numerical methods.

"  Quantum charge pumping phenomenon connects band topology through the dynamics
of a one-dimensional quantum system. In terms of a microscopic model, the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger/Rice-Mele quantum pump continues to serve as a fruitful
starting point for many considerations of topological physics. Here we present
a generalized Creutz scheme as a distinct two-band quantum pump model. By
noting that it undergoes two kinds of topological band transitions accompanying
with a Zak-phase-difference of $\pi$ and $2\pi$, respectively, various charge
pumping schemes are studied by applying an elaborate Peierl's phase
substitution. Translating into real space, the transportation of quantized
charges is a result of cooperative quantum interference effect. In particular,
an all-flux quantum pump emerges which operates with time-varying fluxes only
and transports two charge units. This puts cold atoms with artificial gauge
fields as an unique system where this kind of phenomena can be realized.

"  Foreshock transients upstream of Earth's bow shock have been recently
observed to accelerate electrons to many times their thermal energy. How such
acceleration occurs is unknown, however. Using THEMIS case studies, we examine
a subset of acceleration events (31 of 247 events) in foreshock transients with
cores that exhibit gradual electron energy increases accompanied by low
background magnetic field strength and large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations.
Using the evolution of electron distributions and the energy increase rates at
multiple spacecraft, we suggest that Fermi acceleration between a converging
foreshock transient's compressional boundary and the bow shock is responsible
for the observed electron acceleration. We then show that a one-dimensional
test particle simulation of an ideal Fermi acceleration model in fluctuating
fields prescribed by the observations can reproduce the observed evolution of
electron distributions, energy increase rate, and pitch-angle isotropy,
providing further support for our hypothesis. Thus, Fermi acceleration is
likely the principal electron acceleration mechanism in at least this subset of
foreshock transient cores.
"
"  The quantum speed limit (QSL), or the energy-time uncertainty relation,
describes the fundamental maximum rate for quantum time evolution and has been
regarded as being unique in quantum mechanics. In this study, we obtain a
classical speed limit corresponding to the QSL using the Hilbert space for the
classical Liouville equation. Thus, classical mechanics has a fundamental speed
limit, and QSL is not a purely quantum phenomenon but a universal dynamical
property of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we obtain similar speed limits for
the imaginary-time Schroedinger equations such as the master equation.

"  Informed by LES data and resolvent analysis of the mean flow, we examine the
structure of turbulence in jets in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic
regimes. Spectral (frequency-space) proper orthogonal decomposition is used to
extract energy spectra and decompose the flow into energy-ranked coherent
structures. The educed structures are generally well predicted by the resolvent
analysis. Over a range of low frequencies and the first few azimuthal mode
numbers, these jets exhibit a low-rank response characterized by
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) type wavepackets associated with the annular shear layer
up to the end of the potential core and that are excited by forcing in the
very-near-nozzle shear layer. These modes too the have been experimentally
observed before and predicted by quasi-parallel stability theory and other
approximations--they comprise a considerable portion of the total turbulent
energy. At still lower frequencies, particularly for the axisymmetric mode, and
again at high frequencies for all azimuthal wavenumbers, the response is not
low rank, but consists of a family of similarly amplified modes. These modes,
which are primarily active downstream of the potential core, are associated
with the Orr mechanism. They occur also as sub-dominant modes in the range of
frequencies dominated by the KH response. Our global analysis helps tie
together previous observations based on local spatial stability theory, and
explains why quasi-parallel predictions were successful at some frequencies and
azimuthal wavenumbers, but failed at others.
"
"  The Weyl semimetal phase is a recently discovered topological quantum state
of matter characterized by the presence of topologically protected degeneracies
near the Fermi level. These degeneracies are the source of exotic phenomena,
including the realization of chiral Weyl fermions as quasiparticles in the bulk
and the formation of Fermi arc states on the surfaces. Here, we demonstrate
that these two key signatures show distinct evolutions with the bulk band
topology by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by
first-principle calculations, on transition-metal monophosphides. While Weyl
fermion quasiparticles exist only when the chemical potential is located
between two saddle points of the Weyl cone features, the Fermi arc states
extend in a larger energy scale and are robust across the bulk Lifshitz
transitions associated with the recombination of two non-trivial Fermi surfaces
enclosing one Weyl point into a single trivial Fermi surface enclosing two Weyl
points of opposite chirality. Therefore, in some systems (e.g. NbP),
topological Fermi arc states are preserved even if Weyl fermion quasiparticles
are absent in the bulk. Our findings not only provide insight into the
relationship between the exotic physical phenomena and the intrinsic bulk band
topology in Weyl semimetals, but also resolve the apparent puzzle of the
different magneto-transport properties observed in TaAs, TaP and NbP, where the
Fermi arc states are similar.

"  We report the discovery of three small transiting planets orbiting GJ 9827, a
bright (K = 7.2) nearby late K-type dwarf star. GJ 9827 hosts a $1.62\pm0.11$

$R_{\rm \oplus}$ super Earth on a 3.6 day period, and a $2.07\pm0.14$ $R_{\rm

GJ 9827 span the transition between predominantly rocky and gaseous planets,
and GJ 9827 b and c fall in or close to the known gap in the radius
distribution of small planets between these populations. At a distance of 30
parsecs, GJ 9827 is the closest exoplanet host discovered by K2 to date, making
these planets well-suited for atmospheric studies with the upcoming James Webb

characterize interior structure and atmospheric properties of coeval planets
spanning the rocky to gaseous transition.

"  We define a family of quantum invariants of closed oriented $3$-manifolds
using spherical multi-fusion categories. The state sum nature of this invariant
leads directly to $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories
($\text{TQFT}$s), which generalize the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury
($\text{TVBW}$) $\text{TQFT}$s from spherical fusion categories. The invariant
is given as a state sum over labeled triangulations, which is mostly parallel
to, but richer than the $\text{TVBW}$ approach in that here the labels live not
only on $1$-simplices but also on $0$-simplices. It is shown that a
multi-fusion category in general cannot be a spherical fusion category in the
usual sense. Thus we introduce the concept of a spherical multi-fusion category
by imposing a weakened version of sphericity. Besides containing the
$\text{TVBW}$ theory, our construction also includes the recent higher gauge
theory $(2+1)$-$\text{TQFT}$s given by Kapustin and Thorngren, which was not
known to have a categorical origin before.

"  A numerical analysis of heat conduction through the cover plate of a heat
pipe is carried out to determine the temperature of the working substance,
average temperature of heating and cooling surfaces, heat spread in the
transmitter, and the heat bypass through the cover plate. Analysis has been
extended for the estimation of heat transfer requirements at the outer surface
of the con- denser under different heat load conditions using Genetic
Algorithm. This paper also presents the estimation of an average heat transfer
coefficient for the boiling and condensation of the working substance inside
the microgrooves corresponding to a known temperature of the heat source. The
equation of motion of the working fluid in the meniscus of an equilateral
triangular groove has been presented from which a new term called the minimum
surface tension required for avoiding the dry out condition is defined.
Quantitative results showing the effect of thickness of cover plate, heat load,
angle of inclination and viscosity of the working fluid on the different
aspects of the heat transfer, minimum surface tension required to avoid dry
out, velocity distribution of the liquid, and radius of liquid meniscus inside
the micro-grooves have been presented and discussed.

"  Superconductor-Ferromagnet (SF) heterostructures are of interest due to
numerous phenomena related to the spin-dependent interaction of Cooper pairs
with the magnetization. Here we address the effects of a magnetic insulator on
the density of states of a superconductor based on a recently developed
boundary condition for strongly spin-dependent interfaces. We show that the
boundary to a magnetic insulator has a similar effect like the presence of
magnetic impurities. In particular we find that the impurity effects of
strongly scattering localized spins leading to the formation of Shiba bands can
be mapped onto the boundary problem.

"  In topological quantum computing, information is encoded in ""knotted"" quantum
states of topological phases of matter, thus being locked into topology to
prevent decay. Topological precision has been confirmed in quantum Hall liquids
by experiments to an accuracy of $10^{-10}$, and harnessed to stabilize quantum
memory. In this survey, we discuss the conceptual development of this
interdisciplinary field at the juncture of mathematics, physics and computer
science. Our focus is on computing and physical motivations, basic mathematical
notions and results, open problems and future directions related to and/or
inspired by topological quantum computing.

"  Kitaev quantum spin liquid is a topological magnetic quantum state
characterized by Majorana fermions of fractionalized spin excitations, which
are identical to their own antiparticles. Here, we demonstrate emergence of
Majorana fermions thermally fractionalized in the Kitaev honeycomb spin lattice
{\alpha}-RuCl3. The specific heat data unveil the characteristic two-stage
release of magnetic entropy involving localized and itinerant Majorana
fermions. The inelastic neutron scattering results further corroborate these
two distinct fermions by exhibiting quasielastic excitations at low energies
around the Brillouin zone center and Y-shaped magnetic continuum at high
energies, which are evident for the ferromagnetic Kitaev model. Our results
provide an opportunity to build a unified conceptual framework of
fractionalized excitations, applicable also for the quantum Hall states,
superconductors, and frustrated magnets.

"  Identifying the mechanism by which high energy Lyman continuum (LyC) photons
escaped from early galaxies is one of the most pressing questions in cosmic
evolution. Haro 11 is the best known local LyC leaking galaxy, providing an
important opportunity to test our understanding of LyC escape. The observed LyC
emission in this galaxy presumably originates from one of the three bright,
photoionizing knots known as A, B, and C. It is known that Knot C has strong
Ly$\alpha$ emission, and Knot B hosts an unusually bright ultraluminous X-ray
source, which may be a low-luminosity AGN. To clarify the LyC source, we carry
out ionization-parameter mapping (IPM) by obtaining narrow-band imaging from
the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS cameras to construct spatially resolved
ratio maps of [OIII]/[OII] emission from the galaxy. IPM traces the ionization
structure of the interstellar medium and allows us to identify optically thin
regions. To optimize the continuum subtraction, we introduce a new method for
determining the best continuum scale factor derived from the mode of the
continuum-subtracted, image flux distribution. We find no conclusive evidence
of LyC escape from Knots B or C, but instead, we identify a high-ionization
region extending over at least 1 kpc from Knot A. Knot A shows evidence of an
extremely young age ($\lesssim 1$ Myr), perhaps containing very massive stars
($>100$ M$_\odot$). It is weak in Ly$\alpha$, so if it is confirmed as the LyC
source, our results imply that LyC emission may be independent of Ly$\alpha$
emission.

"  A habitable exoplanet is a world that can maintain stable liquid water on its
surface. Techniques and approaches to characterizing such worlds are essential,
as performing a census of Earth-like planets that may or may not have life will
inform our understanding of how frequently life originates and is sustained on
worlds other than our own. Observational techniques like high contrast imaging
and transit spectroscopy can reveal key indicators of habitability for
exoplanets. Both polarization measurements and specular reflectance from oceans
(also known as ""glint"") can provide direct evidence for surface liquid water,
while constraining surface pressure and temperature (from moderate resolution
spectra) can indicate liquid water stability. Indirect evidence for
habitability can come from a variety of sources, including observations of
variability due to weather, surface mapping studies, and/or measurements of
water vapor or cloud profiles that indicate condensation near a surface.
Approaches to making the types of measurements that indicate habitability are
diverse, and have different considerations for the required wavelength range,
spectral resolution, maximum noise levels, stellar host temperature, and
observing geometry.

"  Many giant exoplanets are found near their Roche limit and in mildly
eccentric orbits. In this study we examine the fate of such planets through
Roche-lobe overflow as a function of the physical properties of the binary
components, including the eccentricity and the asynchronicity of the rotating
planet. We use a direct three-body integrator to compute the trajectories of
the lost mass in the ballistic limit and investigate the possible outcomes. We
find three different outcomes for the mass transferred through the Lagrangian
point $L_{1}$: (i) self-accretion by the planet, (ii) direct impact on the
stellar surface, (iii) disk formation around the star. We explore the parameter
space of the three different regimes and find that at low eccentricities,
$e\lesssim 0.2$, mass overflow leads to disk formation for most systems, while
for higher eccentricities or retrograde orbits self-accretion is the only
possible outcome. We conclude that the assumption often made in previous work
that when a planet overflows its Roche lobe it is quickly disrupted and
accreted by the star is not always valid.

"  A new Short-Orbit Spectrometer (SOS) has been constructed and installed
within the experimental facility of the A1 collaboration at Mainz Microtron
(MAMI), with the goal to detect low-energy pions. It is equipped with a
Browne-Buechner magnet and a detector system consisting of two helium-ethane
based drift chambers and a scintillator telescope made of five layers. The
detector system allows detection of pions in the momentum range of 50 - 147
MeV/c, which corresponds to 8.7 - 63 MeV kinetic energy. The spectrometer can
be placed at a distance range of 54 - 66 cm from the target center. Two
collimators are available for the measurements, one having 1.8 msr aperture and
the other having 7 msr aperture. The Short-Orbit Spectrometer has been
successfully calibrated and used in coincidence measurements together with the
standard magnetic spectrometers of the A1 collaboration.

"  Educational research has shown that narratives are useful tools that can help
young students make sense of scientific phenomena. Based on previous research,
I argue that narratives can also become tools for high school students to make
sense of concepts such as the electric field. In this paper I examine high
school students visual and oral narratives in which they describe the
interaction among electric charges as if they were characters of a cartoon
series. The study investigates: given the prompt to produce narratives for
electrostatic phenomena during a classroom activity prior to receiving formal
instruction, (1) what ideas of electrostatics do students attend to in their
narratives?; (2) what role do students narratives play in their understanding
of electrostatics? The participants were a group of high school students
engaged in an open-ended classroom activity prior to receiving formal
instruction about electrostatics. During the activity, the group was asked to
draw comic strips for electric charges. In addition to individual work,
students shared their work within small groups as well as with the whole group.
Post activity, six students from a small group were interviewed individually
about their work. In this paper I present two cases in which students produced
narratives to express their ideas about electrostatics in different ways. In
each case, I present student work for the comic strip activity (visual
narratives), their oral descriptions of their work (oral narratives) during the
interview and/or to their peers during class, and the their ideas of the
electric interactions expressed through their narratives.

"  Deconstruction of the theme of the 2017 FQXi essay contest is already an
interesting exercise in its own right: Teleology is rarely useful in physics
--- the only known mainstream physics example (black hole event horizons) has a
very mixed score-card --- so the ""goals"" and ""aims and intentions"" alluded to
in the theme of the 2017 FQXi essay contest are already somewhat pushing the
limits. Furthermore, ""aims and intentions"" certainly carries the implication of
consciousness, and opens up a whole can of worms related to the mind-body
problem. As for ""mindless mathematical laws"", that allusion is certainly in
tension with at least some versions of the ""mathematical universe hypothesis"".
Finally ""wandering towards a goal"" again carries the implication of
consciousness, with all its attendant problems.
In this essay I will argue, simply because we do not yet have any really good
mathematical or physical theory of consciousness, that the theme of this essay
contest is premature, and unlikely to lead to any resolution that would be
widely accepted in the mathematics or physics communities.

"  The Atacama Large millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) makes use of water
vapour radiometers (WVR), which monitor the atmospheric water vapour line at
183 GHz along the line of sight above each antenna to correct for phase delays
introduced by the wet component of the troposphere. The application of WVR
derived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful
observations in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We
present work to indicate that a scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can
act to further improve the phase stability and image quality of ALMA data. We
find reduced phase noise statistics for 62 out of 75 datasets from the
long-baseline science verification campaign after a WVR scaling factor is
applied. The improvement of phase noise translates to an expected coherence
improvement in 39 datasets. When imaging the bandpass source, we find 33 of the
39 datasets show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between a
few to ~30 percent. There are 23 datasets where the S/N of the science image is
improved: 6 by <1%, 11 between 1 and 5%, and 6 above 5%. The higher frequencies
studied (band 6 and band 7) are those most improved, specifically datasets with
low precipitable water vapour (PWV), <1mm, where the dominance of the wet
component is reduced. Although these improvements are not profound, phase
stability improvements via the WVR scaling factor come into play for the higher
frequency (>450 GHz) and long-baseline (>5km) observations. These inherently
have poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (<1mm) conditions for
which we find the scaling to be most effective. A promising explanation for the
scaling factor is the mixing of dry and wet air components, although other
origins are discussed. We have produced a python code to allow ALMA users to
undertake WVR scaling tests and make improvements to their data.

"  We consider a modification to the standard cosmological history consisting of
introducing a new species $\phi$ whose energy density red-shifts with the scale
factor $a$ like $\rho_\phi \propto a^{-(4+n)}$. For $n>0$, such a red-shift is
faster than radiation, hence the new species dominates the energy budget of the
universe at early times while it is completely negligible at late times. If
equality with the radiation energy density is achieved at low enough
temperatures, dark matter can be produced as a thermal relic during the new
cosmological phase. Dark matter freeze-out then occurs at higher temperatures
compared to the standard case, implying that reproducing the observed abundance
requires significantly larger annihilation rates. Here, we point out a
completely new phenomenon, which we refer to as $\textit{relentless}$ dark
matter: for large enough $n$, unlike the standard case where annihilation ends
shortly after the departure from thermal equilibrium, dark matter particles
keep annihilating long after leaving chemical equilibrium, with a significant
depletion of the final relic abundance. Relentless annihilation occurs for $n
\geq 2$ and $n \geq 4$ for s-wave and p-wave annihilation, respectively, and it
thus occurs in well motivated scenarios such as a quintessence with a kination
phase. We discuss a few microscopic realizations for the new cosmological
component and highlight the phenomenological consequences of our calculations
for dark matter searches.

"  Topology has appeared in different physical contexts. The most prominent
application is topologically protected edge transport in condensed matter
physics. The Chern number, the topological invariant of gapped Bloch
Hamiltonians, is an important quantity in this field. Another example of
topology, in polarization physics, are polarization singularities, called L
lines and C points. By establishing a connection between these two theories, we
develop a novel technique to visualize and potentially measure the Chern
number: it can be expressed either as the winding of the polarization azimuth
along L lines in reciprocal space, or in terms of the handedness and the index
of the C points. For mechanical systems, this is directly connected to the
visible motion patterns.

"  The coupled exciton-vibrational dynamics of a three-site model of the FMO
complex is investigated using the Multi-layer Multi-configuration
Time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) approach. Emphasis is put on the effect of
the spectral density on the exciton state populations as well as on the
vibrational and vibronic non-equilibrium excitations. Models which use either a
single or site-specific spectral densities are contrasted to a spectral density
adapted from experiment. For the transfer efficiency, the total integrated
Huang-Rhys factor is found to be more important than details of the spectral
distributions. However, the latter are relevant for the obtained
non-equilibrium vibrational and vibronic distributions and thus influence the
actual pattern of population relaxation.
"
"  Parametric resonance is among the most efficient phenomena generating
gravitational waves (GWs) in the early Universe. The dynamics of parametric
resonance, and hence of the GWs, depend exclusively on the resonance parameter
$q$. The latter is determined by the properties of each scenario: the initial
amplitude and potential curvature of the oscillating field, and its coupling to
other species. Previous works have only studied the GW production for fixed
value(s) of $q$. We present an analytical derivation of the GW amplitude
dependence on $q$, valid for any scenario, which we confront against numerical
results. By running lattice simulations in an expanding grid, we study for a
wide range of $q$ values, the production of GWs in post-inflationary preheating
scenarios driven by parametric resonance. We present simple fits for the final
amplitude and position of the local maxima in the GW spectrum. Our
parametrization allows to predict the location and amplitude of the GW
background today, for an arbitrary $q$. The GW signal can be rather large, as
$h^2\Omega_{\rm GW}(f_p) \lesssim 10^{-11}$, but it is always peaked at high
frequencies $f_p \gtrsim 10^{7}$ Hz. We also discuss the case of
spectator-field scenarios, where the oscillatory field can be e.g.~a curvaton,
or the Standard Model Higgs.

"  The 1+1 REMPI spectrum of SiO in the 210-220 nm range is recorded. Observed
bands are assigned to the $A-X$ vibrational bands $(v``=0-3, v`=5-10)$ and a
tentative assignment is given to the 2-photon transition from $X$ to the
n=12-13 $[X^{2}{\Sigma}^{+},v^{+}=1]$ Rydberg states at 216-217 nm. We estimate
the IP of SiO to be 11.59(1) eV. The SiO$^{+}$ cation has previously been
identified as a molecular candidate amenable to laser control. Our work allows
us to identify an efficient method for loading cold SiO$^{+}$ from an ablated
sample of SiO into an ion trap via the $(5,0)$ $A-X$ band at 213.977 nm.

"  We study the two-dimensional topology of the galactic distribution when
projected onto two-dimensional spherical shells. Using the latest Horizon Run 4
simulation data, we construct the genus of the two-dimensional field and
consider how this statistic is affected by late-time nonlinear effects --
principally gravitational collapse and redshift space distortion (RSD). We also
consider systematic and numerical artifacts such as shot noise, galaxy bias,
and finite pixel effects. We model the systematics using a Hermite polynomial
expansion and perform a comprehensive analysis of known effects on the
two-dimensional genus, with a view toward using the statistic for cosmological
parameter estimation. We find that the finite pixel effect is dominated by an
amplitude drop and can be made less than $1\%$ by adopting pixels smaller than
$1/3$ of the angular smoothing length. Nonlinear gravitational evolution
introduces time-dependent coefficients of the zeroth, first, and second Hermite
polynomials, but the genus amplitude changes by less than $1\%$ between $z=1$
and $z=0$ for smoothing scales $R_{\rm G} > 9 {\rm Mpc/h}$. Non-zero terms are
measured up to third order in the Hermite polynomial expansion when studying
RSD. Differences in shapes of the genus curves in real and redshift space are
small when we adopt thick redshift shells, but the amplitude change remains a
significant $\sim {\cal O}(10\%)$ effect. The combined effects of galaxy
biasing and shot noise produce systematic effects up to the second Hermite
polynomial. It is shown that, when sampling, the use of galaxy mass cuts
significantly reduces the effect of shot noise relative to random sampling.
"
"  During the ionization of atoms irradiated by linearly polarized intense laser
fields, we find for the first time that the transverse momentum distribution of
photoelectrons can be well fitted by a squared zeroth-order Bessel function
because of the quantum interference effect of Glory rescattering. The
characteristic of the Bessel function is determined by the common angular
momentum of a bunch of semiclassical paths termed as Glory trajectories, which
are launched with different nonzero initial transverse momenta distributed on a
specific circle in the momentum plane and finally deflected to the same
asymptotic momentum, which is along the polarization direction, through
post-tunneling rescattering. Glory rescattering theory (GRT) based on the
semiclassical path-integral formalism is developed to address this effect
quantitatively. Our theory can resolve the long-standing discrepancies between
existing theories and experiments on the fringe location, predict the sudden
transition of the fringe structure in holographic patterns, and shed light on
the quantum interference aspects of low-energy structures in strong-field
atomic ionization.

"  We describe the design and implementation of an extremely scalable real-time
RFI mitigation method, based on the offline AOFlagger. All algorithms scale
linearly in the number of samples. We describe how we implemented the flagger
in the LOFAR real-time pipeline, on both CPUs and GPUs. Additionally, we
introduce a novel simple history-based flagger that helps reduce the impact of
our small window on the data.
By examining an observation of a known pulsar, we demonstrate that our
flagger can achieve much higher quality than a simple thresholder, even when
running in real time, on a distributed system. The flagger works on visibility
data, but also on raw voltages, and beam formed data. The algorithms are
scale-invariant, and work on microsecond to second time scales. We are
currently implementing a prototype for the time domain pipeline of the SKA
central signal processor.

"  We study the phase space dynamics of cosmological models in the theoretical
formulations of non-minimal metric-torsion couplings with a scalar field, and
investigate in particular the critical points which yield stable solutions
exhibiting cosmic acceleration driven by the {\em dark energy}. The latter is
defined in a way that it effectively has no direct interaction with the
cosmological fluid, although in an equivalent scalar-tensor cosmological setup
the scalar field interacts with the fluid (which we consider to be the
pressureless dust). Determining the conditions for the existence of the stable
critical points we check their physical viability, in both Einstein and Jordan
frames. We also verify that in either of these frames, the evolution of the
universe at the corresponding stable points matches with that given by the
respective exact solutions we have found in an earlier work (arXiv: 1611.00654
[gr-qc]). We not only examine the regions of physical relevance for the
trajectories in the phase space when the coupling parameter is varied, but also
demonstrate the evolution profiles of the cosmological parameters of interest
along fiducial trajectories in the effectively non-interacting scenarios, in
both Einstein and Jordan frames.

"  To probe the star-formation (SF) processes, we present results of an analysis
of the molecular cloud G35.20$-$0.74 (hereafter MCG35.2) using multi-frequency
observations. The MCG35.2 is depicted in a velocity range of 30-40 km s$^{-1}$.
An almost horseshoe-like structure embedded within the MCG35.2 is evident in
the infrared and millimeter images and harbors the previously known sites,
ultra-compact/hyper-compact G35.20$-$0.74N H\,{\sc ii} region, Ap2-1, and
Mercer 14 at its base. The site, Ap2-1 is found to be excited by a radio
spectral type of B0.5V star where the distribution of 20 cm and H$\alpha$
emission is surrounded by the extended molecular hydrogen emission. Using the
{\it Herschel} 160-500 $\mu$m and photometric 1-24 $\mu$m data analysis,
several embedded clumps and clusters of young stellar objects (YSOs) are
investigated within the MCG35.2, revealing the SF activities. Majority of the
YSOs clusters and massive clumps (500-4250 M$_{\odot}$) are seen toward the
horseshoe-like structure. The position-velocity analysis of $^{13}$CO emission
shows a blue-shifted peak (at 33 km s$^{-1}$) and a red-shifted peak (at 37 km
s$^{-1}$) interconnected by lower intensity intermediated velocity emission,
tracing a broad bridge feature. The presence of such broad bridge feature
suggests the onset of a collision between molecular components in the MCG35.2.
A noticeable change in the H-band starlight mean polarization angles has also
been observed in the MCG35.2, probably tracing the interaction between
molecular components. Taken together, it seems that the cloud-cloud collision
process has influenced the birth of massive stars and YSOs clusters in the
MCG35.2.

"  Helmholtz decomposition theorem for vector fields is usually presented with
too strong restrictions on the fields and only for time independent fields.
Blumenthal showed in 1905 that decomposition is possible for any asymptotically
weakly decreasing vector field. He used a regularization method in his proof
which can be extended to prove the theorem even for vector fields
asymptotically increasing sublinearly. Blumenthal's result is then applied to
the time-dependent fields of the dipole radiation and an artificial sublinearly
increasing field.

"  Tidal streams of disrupting dwarf galaxies orbiting around their host galaxy
offer a unique way to constrain the shape of galactic gravitational potentials.
Such streams can be used as leaning tower gravitational experiments on galactic
scales. The most well motivated modification of gravity proposed as an
alternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND),
and we present here the first ever N-body simulations of the dynamical
evolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a
realistic baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we attempt to reproduce the
present-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf and its
immense tidal stream that wraps around the Milky Way. With very little freedom
on the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total
luminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size
relation for isolated dwarf galaxies, we find reasonable agreement between our
simulations and observations of this system. The observed stellar velocities in
the leading arm can be reproduced if we include a massive hot gas corona around
the Milky Way that is flattened in the direction of the principal plane of its
satellites. This is the first time that tidal dissolution in MOND has been
tested rigorously at these mass and acceleration scales.

"  The response of an electron system to electromagnetic fields with sharp
spatial variations is strongly dependent on quantum electronic properties, even
in ambient conditions, but difficult to access experimentally. We use
propagating graphene plasmons, together with an engineered dielectric-metallic
environment, to probe the graphene electron liquid and unveil its detailed
electronic response at short wavelengths.The near-field imaging experiments
reveal a parameter-free match with the full theoretical quantum description of
the massless Dirac electron gas, in which we identify three types of quantum
effects as keys to understanding the experimental response of graphene to
short-ranged terahertz electric fields. The first type is of single-particle
nature and is related to shape deformations of the Fermi surface during a
plasmon oscillations. The second and third types are a many-body effect
controlled by the inertia and compressibility of the interacting electron
liquid in graphene. We demonstrate how, in principle, our experimental approach
can determine the full spatiotemporal response of an electron system.

"  A new generation of solar instruments provides improved spectral, spatial,
and temporal resolution, thus facilitating a better understanding of dynamic
processes on the Sun. High-resolution observations often reveal
multiple-component spectral line profiles, e.g., in the near-infrared He I
10830 \AA\ triplet, which provides information about the chromospheric velocity
and magnetic fine structure. We observed an emerging flux region, including two
small pores and an arch filament system, on 2015 April 17 with the 'very fast
spectroscopic mode' of the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) situated at the
1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. We
discuss this method of obtaining fast (one per minute) spectral scans of the
solar surface and its potential to follow dynamic processes on the Sun. We
demonstrate the performance of the 'very fast spectroscopic mode' by tracking
chromospheric high-velocity features in the arch filament system.

"  The real Scarf II potential is discussed as a radial problem. This potential
has been studied extensively as a one-dimensional problem, and now these
results are used to construct its bound and resonance solutions for $l=0$ by
setting the origin at some arbitrary value of the coordinate. The solutions
with appropriate boundary conditions are composed as the linear combination of
the two independent solutions of the Schrödinger equation. The asymptotic
expression of these solutions is used to construct the $S_0(k)$ s-wave
$S$-matrix, the poles of which supply the $k$ values corresponding to the
bound, resonance and anti-bound solutions. The location of the discrete energy
eigenvalues is analyzed, and the relation of the solutions of the radial and
one-dimensional Scarf II potentials is discussed. It is shown that the
generalized Woods--Saxon potential can be generated from the Rosen--Morse II
potential in the same way as the radial Scarf II potential is obtained from its
one-dimensional correspondent. Based on this analogy, possible applications are
also pointed out.

"  In the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-aether theory we study the
birefringence effect, which can occur in the pp-wave symmetric dynamic aether.
The dynamic aether is considered to be latently birefringent quasi-medium,
which displays this hidden property if and only if the aether motion is
non-uniform, i.e., when the aether flow is characterized by the non-vanishing
expansion, shear, vorticity or acceleration. In accordance with the
dynamo-optical scheme of description of the interaction between electromagnetic
waves and the dynamic aether, we shall model the susceptibility tensors by the
terms linear in the covariant derivative of the aether velocity four-vector.
When the pp-wave modes appear in the dynamic aether, we deal with a
gravitationally induced degeneracy removal with respect to hidden
susceptibility parameters. As a consequence, the phase velocities of
electromagnetic waves possessing orthogonal polarizations do not coincide, thus
displaying the birefringence effect. Two electromagnetic field configurations
are studied in detail: longitudinal and transversal with respect to the aether
pp-wave front. For both cases the solutions are found, which reveal anomalies
in the electromagnetic response on the action of the pp-wave aether mode.

"  In this Letter, we study the motion and wake-patterns of freely rising and
falling cylinders in quiescent fluid. We show that the amplitude of oscillation
and the overall system-dynamics are intricately linked to two parameters: the
particle's mass-density relative to the fluid $m^* \equiv \rho_p/\rho_f$ and
its relative moment-of-inertia $I^* \equiv {I}_p/{I}_f$. This supersedes the
current understanding that a critical mass density ($m^*\approx$ 0.54) alone
triggers the sudden onset of vigorous vibrations. Using over 144 combinations
of ${m}^*$ and $I^*$, we comprehensively map out the parameter space covering
very heavy ($m^* > 10$) to very buoyant ($m^* < 0.1$) particles. The entire
data collapses into two scaling regimes demarcated by a transitional Strouhal
number, $St_t \approx 0.17$. $St_t$ separates a mass-dominated regime from a
regime dominated by the particle's moment of inertia. A shift from one regime
to the other also marks a gradual transition in the wake-shedding pattern: from
the classical $2S$~(2-Single) vortex mode to a $2P$~(2-Pairs) vortex mode.
Thus, auto-rotation can have a significant influence on the trajectories and
wakes of freely rising isotropic bodies.

"  Large-scale extragalactic magnetic fields may induce conversions between
very-high-energy photons and axionlike particles (ALPs), thereby shielding the
photons from absorption on the extragalactic background light. However, in
simplified ""cell"" models, used so far to represent extragalactic magnetic
fields, this mechanism would be strongly suppressed by current astrophysical
bounds. Here we consider a recent model of extragalactic magnetic fields
obtained from large-scale cosmological simulations. Such simulated magnetic
fields would have large enhancement in the filaments of matter. As a result,
photon-ALP conversions would produce a significant spectral hardening for
cosmic TeV photons. This effect would be probed with the upcoming Cherenkov
Telescope Array detector. This possible detection would give a unique chance to
perform a tomography of the magnetized cosmic web with ALPs.

"  Predicting the future state of a system has always been a natural motivation
for science and practical applications. Such a topic, beyond its obvious
technical and societal relevance, is also interesting from a conceptual point
of view. This owes to the fact that forecasting lends itself to two equally
radical, yet opposite methodologies. A reductionist one, based on the first
principles, and the naive inductivist one, based only on data. This latter view
has recently gained some attention in response to the availability of
unprecedented amounts of data and increasingly sophisticated algorithmic
analytic techniques. The purpose of this note is to assess critically the role
of big data in reshaping the key aspects of forecasting and in particular the
claim that bigger data leads to better predictions. Drawing on the
representative example of weather forecasts we argue that this is not generally
the case. We conclude by suggesting that a clever and context-dependent
compromise between modelling and quantitative analysis stands out as the best
forecasting strategy, as anticipated nearly a century ago by Richardson and von
Neumann.

"  We investigate the spin structure of a uni-axial chiral magnet near the
transition temperatures in low fields perpendicular to the helical axis. We
find a fan-type modulation structure where the clockwise and counterclockwise
windings appear alternatively along the propagation direction of the modulation
structure. This structure is often realized in a Yoshimori-type (non-chiral)
helimagnet but it is rarely realized in a chiral helimagnet. To discuss
underlying physics of this structure, we reconsider the phase diagram (phase
boundary and crossover lines) through the free energy and asymptotic behaviors
of isolated solitons. The fan structure appears slightly below the phase
boundary of the continuous transition of instability-type. In this region,
there are no solutions containing any types of isolated solitons to the mean
field equations.

"  Several natural satellites of the giant planets have shown evidence of a
global internal ocean, coated by a thin, icy crust. This crust is probably
viscoelastic, which would alter its rotational response. This response would
translate into several rotational quantities, i.e. the obliquity, and the
librations at different frequencies, for which the crustal elasticity reacts
differently. This study aims at modelling the global response of the
viscoelastic crust. For that, I derive the time-dependency of the tensor of
inertia, which I combine with the time evolution of the rotational quantities,
thanks to an iterative algorithm. This algorithm combines numerical simulations
of the rotation with a digital filtering of the resulting tensor of inertia.
The algorithm works very well in the elastic case, provided the problem is not
resonant. However, considering tidal dissipation adds different phase lags to
the oscillating contributions, which challenge the convergence of the
algorithm.

"  We further progress along the line of Ref. [Phys. Rev. {\bf A 94}, 043614
(2016)] where a functional for Fermi systems with anomalously large $s$-wave
scattering length $a_s$ was proposed that has no free parameters. The
functional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases
together with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at
low density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities
$\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang
functional, valid for $\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional
retained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional
corresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all
orders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One
conclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density
regime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with
respect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce
density--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare
interaction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some
of the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas
properties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that
the scale in the s-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the
so-called Bertsch parameter $\xi_0$ and becomes independent of $a_s$. We also
point out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those
empirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional. We finally
propose a slight modification of the functional such that it becomes accurate
up to the saturation density $\rho\simeq 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$.

"  We present a set of effective outflow/open boundary conditions and an
associated algorithm for simulating the dynamics of multiphase flows consisting
of $N$ ($N\geqslant 2$) immiscible incompressible fluids in domains involving
outflows or open boundaries. These boundary conditions are devised based on the
properties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability
property ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the
energy balance will not cause the total energy of the N-phase system to
increase over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary conditions are very
effective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems. The
reduction consistency property ensures that if some fluid components are absent
from the N-phase system then these N-phase boundary conditions will reduce to
those corresponding boundary conditions for the equivalent smaller system. Our
numerical algorithm for the proposed boundary conditions together with the
N-phase governing equations involves only the solution of a set of de-coupled
individual Helmholtz-type equations within each time step, and the resultant
linear algebraic systems after discretization involve only constant and
time-independent coefficient matrices which can be pre-computed. Therefore, the
algorithm is computationally very efficient and attractive. We present
extensive numerical experiments for flow problems involving multiple fluid
components and inflow/outflow boundaries to test the proposed method. In
particular, we compare in detail the simulation results of a three-phase
capillary wave problem with Prosperetti's exact physical solution and
demonstrate that the method developed herein produces physically accurate
results.

"  The recent detection of two faint and extended star clusters in the central
regions of two Local Group dwarf galaxies, Eridanus II and Andromeda XXV,
raises the question of whether clusters with such low densities can survive the
tidal field of cold dark matter haloes with central density cusps. Using both
analytic arguments and a suite of collisionless N-body simulations, I show that
these clusters are extremely fragile and quickly disrupted in the presence of
central cusps $\rho\sim r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\gtrsim 0.2$. Furthermore, the
scenario in which the clusters where originally more massive and sank to the
center of the halo requires extreme fine tuning and does not naturally
reproduce the observed systems. In turn, these clusters are long lived in cored
haloes, whose central regions are safe shelters for $\alpha\lesssim 0.2$. The
only viable scenario for hosts that have preserved their primoridal cusp to the
present time is that the clusters formed at rest at the bottom of the
potential, which is easily tested by measurement of the clusters proper
velocity within the host. This offers means to readily probe the central
density profile of two dwarf galaxies as faint as $L_V\sim5\times 10^5 L_\odot$
and $L_V\sim6\times10^4 L_\odot$, in which stellar feedback is unlikely to be
effective.
"
"  Galaxy cluster centring is a key issue for precision cosmology studies using
galaxy surveys. Mis-identification of central galaxies causes systematics in
various studies such as cluster lensing, satellite kinematics, and galaxy
clustering. The red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation
(redMaPPer) estimates the probability that each member galaxy is central from
photometric information rather than specifying one central galaxy. The
redMaPPer estimates can be used for calibrating the off-centring effect,
however, the centring algorithm has not previously been well-tested. We test
the centring probabilities of redMaPPer cluster catalog using the projected
cross correlation between redMaPPer clusters with photometric red galaxies and
galaxy-galaxy lensing. We focus on the subsample of redMaPPer clusters in which
the redMaPPer central galaxies (RMCGs) are not the brightest member galaxies
(BMEM) and both of them have spectroscopic redshift. This subsample represents
nearly 10% of the whole cluster sample. We find a clear difference in the
cross-correlation measurements between RMCGs and BMEMs, and the estimated
centring probability is 74$\pm$10% for RMCGs and 13$\pm$4% for BMEMs in the
Gaussian offset model and 78$\pm$9% for RMCGs and 5$\pm$5% for BMEMs in the NFW
offset model. These values are in agreement with the centring probability
values reported by redMaPPer (75% for RMCG and 10% for BMEMs) within 1$\sigma$.
Our analysis provides a strong consistency test of the redMaPPer centring
probabilities. Our results suggest that redMaPPer centring probabilities are
reliably estimated. We confirm that the brightest galaxy in the cluster is not
always the central galaxy as has been shown in previous works.

"  The ongoing progress in quantum theory emphasizes the crucial role of the
very basic principles of quantum theory. However, this is not properly followed
in teaching quantum mechanics on the graduate and undergraduate levels of
physics studies. The existing textbooks typically avoid the axiomatic
presentation of the theory. We emphasize usefulness of the systematic,
axiomatic approach to the basics of quantum theory as well as its importance in
the light of the modern scientific-research context.

"  Variational approaches for the calculation of vibrational wave functions and
energies are a natural route to obtain highly accurate results with
controllable errors. However, the unfavorable scaling and the resulting high
computational cost of standard variational approaches limit their application
to small molecules with only few vibrational modes. Here, we demonstrate how
the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) can be exploited to optimize
vibrational wave functions (vDMRG) expressed as matrix product states. We study
the convergence of these calculations with respect to the size of the local
basis of each mode, the number of renormalized block states, and the number of
DMRG sweeps required. We demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by vDMRG for
small molecules that were intensively studied in the literature. We then
proceed to show that the complete fingerprint region of the sarcosyn-glycin
dipeptide can be calculated with vDMRG.
"
"  Despite numerous studies the exact nature of the order parameter in
superconducting Sr2RuO4 remains unresolved. We have extended previous
small-angle neutron scattering studies of the vortex lattice in this material
to a wider field range, higher temperatures, and with the field applied close
to both the <100> and <110> basal plane directions. Measurements at high field
were made possible by the use of both spin polarization and analysis to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. Rotating the field towards the basal plane causes a
distortion of the square vortex lattice observed for H // <001>, and also a
symmetry change to a distorted triangular symmetry for fields close to <100>.
The vortex lattice distortion allows us to determine the intrinsic
superconducting anisotropy between the c-axis and the Ru-O basal plane,
yielding a value of ~60 at low temperature and low to intermediate fields. This
greatly exceeds the upper critical field anisotropy of ~20 at low temperature,
reminiscent of Pauli limiting. Indirect evidence for Pauli paramagnetic effects
on the unpaired quasiparticles in the vortex cores are observed, but a direct
detection lies below the measurement sensitivity. The superconducting
anisotropy is found to be independent of temperature but increases for fields >
1 T, indicating multiband superconductvity in Sr2RuO4. Finally, the temperature
dependence of the scattered intensity provides further support for gap nodes or
deep minima in the superconducting gap.
"
"  We study $SU(N)$ Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in 3+1 dimensions with $N_f$
degenerate fundamental quarks with mass $m$ and a $\theta$-parameter. For
generic $m$ and $\theta$ the theory has a single gapped vacuum. However, as
$\theta$ is varied through $\theta=\pi$ for large $m$ there is a first order
transition. For $N_f=1$ the first order transition line ends at a point with a
massless $\eta'$ particle (for all $N$) and for $N_f>1$ the first order
transition ends at $m=0$, where, depending on the value of $N_f$, the IR theory
has free Nambu-Goldstone bosons, an interacting conformal field theory, or a
free gauge theory. Even when the $4d$ bulk is smooth, domain walls and
interfaces can have interesting phase transitions separating different $3d$
phases. These turn out to be the phases of the recently studied $3d$
Chern-Simons matter theories, thus relating the dynamics of QCD$_4$ and
QCD$_3$, and, in particular, making contact with the recently discussed
dualities in 2+1 dimensions. For example, when the massless $4d$ theory has an
$SU(N_f)$ sigma model, the domain wall theory at low (nonzero) mass supports a
$3d$ massless $CP^{N_f-1}$ nonlinear $\sigma$-model with a Wess-Zumino term, in
agreement with the conjectured dynamics in 2+1 dimensions.
"
"  Investigation of the autoignition delay of the butanol isomers has been
performed at elevated pressures of 15 bar and 30 bar and low to intermediate
temperatures of 680-860 K. The reactivity of the stoichiometric isomers of
butanol, in terms of inverse ignition delay, was ranked as n-butanol >
sec-butanol ~ iso-butanol > tert-butanol at a compressed pressure of 15 bar but
changed to n-butanol > tert-butanol > sec-butanol > iso-butanol at 30 bar. For
the temperature and pressure conditions in this study, no NTC or two-stage
ignition behavior were observed. However, for both of the compressed pressures
studied in this work, tert-butanol exhibited unique pre-ignition heat release
characteristics. As such, tert-butanol was further studied at two additional
equivalence ratios ($\phi$ = 0.5 and 2.0) to help determine the cause of the
heat release.
"
"  We define rules for cellular automata played on quasiperiodic tilings of the
plane arising from the multigrid method in such a way that these cellular
automata are isomorphic to Conway's Game of Life. Although these tilings are
nonperiodic, determining the next state of each tile is a local computation,
requiring only knowledge of the local structure of the tiling and the states of
finitely many nearby tiles. As an example, we show a version of a ""glider""
moving through a region of a Penrose tiling. This constitutes a potential
theoretical framework for a method of executing computations in
non-periodically structured substrates such as quasicrystals.
"
"  In the present work, we explore the existence, stability and dynamics of
single and multiple vortex ring states that can arise in Bose-Einstein
condensates. Earlier works have illustrated the bifurcation of such states, in
the vicinity of the linear limit, for isotropic or anisotropic
three-dimensional harmonic traps. Here, we extend these states to the regime of
large chemical potentials, the so-called Thomas-Fermi limit, and explore their
properties such as equilibrium radii and inter-ring distance, for multi-ring
states, as well as their vibrational spectra and possible instabilities. In
this limit, both the existence and stability characteristics can be partially
traced to a particle picture that considers the rings as individual particles
oscillating within the trap and interacting pairwise with one another. Finally,
we examine some representative instability scenarios of the multi-ring dynamics
including breakup and reconnections, as well as the transient formation of
vortex lines.
"
"  We study the motion of an electron bubble in the zero temperature limit where
neither phonons nor rotons provide a significant contribution to the drag
exerted on an ion moving within the superfluid. By using the Gross-Clark model,
in which a Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the superfluid wavefunction is coupled
to a Schrödinger equation for the electron wavefunction, we study how
vortex nucleation affects the measured drift velocity of the ion. We use
parameters that give realistic values of the ratio of the radius of the bubble
with respect to the healing length in superfluid $^4$He at a pressure of one
bar. By performing fully 3D spatio-temporal simulations of the superfluid
coupled to an electron, that is modelled within an adiabatic approximation and
moving under the influence of an applied electric field, we are able to recover
the key dynamics of the ion-vortex interactions that arise and the subsequent
ion-vortex complexes that can form. Using the numerically computed drift
velocity of the ion as a function of the applied electric field, we determine
the vortex-nucleation limited mobility of the ion to recover values in
reasonable agreement with measured data.

"  We present new JVLA multi-frequency measurements of a set of stars in
transition from the post-AGB to the Planetary Nebula phase monitored in the
radio range over several years. Clear variability is found for five sources.
Their light curves show increasing and decreasing patterns. New radio
observations at high angular resolution are also presented for two sources.
Among these is IRAS 18062+2410, whose radio structure is compared to
near-infrared images available in the literature. With these new maps, we can
estimate inner and outer radii of 0.03$""$ and 0.08$""$ for the ionised shell, an
ionised mass of $3.2\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$, and a density at the inner radius
of $7.7\times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, obtained by modelling the radio shell with
the new morphological constraints. The combination of multi-frequency data and,
where available, spectral-index maps leads to the detection of spectral indices
not due to thermal emission, contrary to what one would expect in planetary
nebulae. Our results allow us to hypothesise the existence of a link between
radio variability and non-thermal emission mechanisms in the nebulae. This link
seems to hold for IRAS 22568+6141 and may generally hold for those nebulae
where the radio flux decreases over time.
"
"  Strong-coupling of monolayer metal dichalcogenide semiconductors with light
offers encouraging prospects for realistic exciton devices at room temperature.
However, the nature of this coupling depends extremely sensitively on the
optical confinement and the orientation of electronic dipoles and fields. Here,
we show how plasmon strong coupling can be achieved in compact robust
easily-assembled gold nano-gap resonators at room temperature. We prove that
strong coupling is impossible with monolayers due to the large exciton
coherence size, but resolve clear anti-crossings for 8 layer devices with Rabi
splittings exceeding 135 meV. We show that such structures improve on prospects
for nonlinear exciton functionalities by at least 10^4, while retaining quantum
efficiencies above 50%.

"  We consider the problem related to clustering of gamma-ray bursts (from
""BATSE"" catalogue) through kernel principal component analysis in which our
proposed kernel outperforms results of other competent kernels in terms of
clustering accuracy and we obtain three physically interpretable groups of
gamma-ray bursts. The effectivity of the suggested kernel in combination with
kernel principal component analysis in revealing natural clusters in noisy and
nonlinear data while reducing the dimension of the data is also explored in two
simulated data sets.
"
"  Modeling the interior of exoplanets is essential to go further than the
conclusions provided by mean density measurements. In addition to the still
limited precision on the planets' fundamental parameters, models are limited by
the existence of degeneracies on their compositions. Here we present a model of
internal structure dedicated to the study of solid planets up to ~10 Earth
masses, i.e. Super-Earths. When the measurement is available, the assumption
that the bulk Fe/Si ratio of a planet is similar to that of its host star
allows us to significantly reduce the existing degeneracy and more precisely
constrain the planet's composition. Based on our model, we provide an update of
the mass-radius relationships used to provide a first estimate of a planet's
composition from density measurements. Our model is also applied to the cases
of two well-known exoplanets, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, using their recently
updated parameters. The core mass fractions of CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b are
found to lie within the 10-37% and 10-33% ranges, respectively, allowing both
planets to be compatible with an Earth-like composition. We also extend the
recent study of Proxima Centauri b, and show that its radius may reach 1.94
Earth radii in the case of a 5 Earth masses planet, as there is a 96.7%
probability that the real mass of Proxima Centauri b is below this value.

"  In this paper we discuss the characteristics and operation of Astro Space
Center (ASC) software FX correlator that is an important component of
space-ground interferometer for Radioastron project. This project performs
joint observations of compact radio sources using 10 meter space radio
telescope (SRT) together with ground radio telescopes at 92, 18, 6 and 1.3 cm
wavelengths. In this paper we describe the main features of space-ground VLBI
data processing of Radioastron project using ASC correlator. Quality of
implemented fringe search procedure provides positive results without
significant losses in correlated amplitude. ASC Correlator has a computational
power close to real time operation. The correlator has a number of processing
modes: ""Continuum"", ""Spectral Line"", ""Pulsars"", ""Giant Pulses"",""Coherent"".
Special attention is paid to peculiarities of Radioastron space-ground VLBI
data processing. The algorithms of time delay and delay rate calculation are
also discussed, which is a matter of principle for data correlation of
space-ground interferometers. During 5 years of Radioastron space radio
telescope (SRT) successful operation, ASC correlator showed high potential of
satisfying steady growing needs of current and future ground and space VLBI
science. Results of ASC software correlator operation are demonstrated.

"  We present a compact design for a velocity-map imaging spectrometer for
energetic electrons and ions. The standard geometry by Eppink and Parker [A. T.
J. B. Eppink and D. H. Parker, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 68, 3477 (1997)] is augmented
by just two extended electrodes so as to realize an additional einzel lens. In
this way, for a maximum electrode voltage of 7 kV we experimentally demonstrate
imaging of electrons with energies up to 65 eV. Simulations show that energy
acceptances of <270 and <1,200 eV with an energy resolution of dE / E <5% are
achievable for electrode voltages of <20 kV when using diameters of the
position-sensitive detector of 42 and 78 mm, respectively.

"  The energy efficiency and power of a three-terminal thermoelectric nanodevice
are studied by considering elastic tunneling through a single quantum dot.
Facilitated by the three-terminal geometry, the nanodevice is able to generate
simultaneously two electrical powers by utilizing only one temperature bias.
These two electrical powers can add up constructively or destructively,
depending on their signs. It is demonstrated that the constructive addition
leads to the enhancement of both energy efficiency and output power for various
system parameters. In fact, such enhancement, dubbed as thermoelectric
cooperative effect, can lead to maximum efficiency and power no less than when
only one of the electrical power is harvested.
"
"  We demonstrate the parallel and non-destructive readout of the hyperfine
state for optically trapped $^{87}$Rb atoms. The scheme is based on
state-selective fluorescence imaging and achieves detection fidelities $>$98%
within 10$\,$ms, while keeping 99% of the atoms trapped. For the read-out of
dense arrays of neutral atoms in optical lattices, where the fluorescence
images of neighboring atoms overlap, we apply a novel image analysis technique
using Bayesian inference to determine the internal state of multiple atoms. Our
method is scalable to large neutral atom registers relevant for future quantum
information processing tasks requiring fast and non-destructive readout and can
also be used for the simultaneous read-out of quantum information stored in
internal qubit states and in the atoms' positions.
"
"  Dust devils are likely the dominant source of dust for the martian
atmosphere, but the amount and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the
statistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure
perturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as
a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several
surveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil
structures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such
surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil
properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with
the widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be
distorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such
surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure
time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series
cannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical
and geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of
the duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a
distribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the
underlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a
scheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey
using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil
occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our
results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five
low-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.

"  With the help of first principles calculation method based on the density
functional theory we have investigated the structural, elastic, mechanical
properties and Debye temperature of Fe2ScM (M = P and As) compounds under
pressure up to 60 GPa. The optical properties have been investigated under zero
pressure. Our calculated optimized structural parameters of both the compounds
are in good agreement with the other theoretical results. The calculated
elastic constants show that Fe2ScM (M = P and As) compounds are mechanically
stable up to 60 GPa.

"  This paper presents a topology optimization framework for structural problems
subjected to transient loading. The mechanical model assumes a linear elastic
isotropic material, infinitesimal strains, and a dynamic response. The
optimization problem is solved using the gradient-based optimizer Method of
Moving Asymptotes (MMA) with time-dependent sensitivities provided via the
adjoint method. The stiffness of materials is interpolated using the Solid
Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method and the Heaviside Projection
Method (HPM) is used to stabilize the problem numerically and improve the
manufacturability of the topology-optimized designs. Both static and dynamic
optimization examples are considered here. The resulting optimized designs
demonstrate the ability of topology optimization to tailor the transient
response of structures.

"  High-mass stars are expected to form from dense prestellar cores. Their
precise formation conditions are widely discussed, including their virial
condition, which results in slow collapse for super-virial cores with strong
support by turbulence or magnetic fields, or fast collapse for sub-virial
sources. To disentangle their formation processes, measurements of the
deuterium fractions are frequently employed to approximately estimate the ages
of these cores and to obtain constraints on their dynamical evolution. We here
present 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including for the first time an
accurate non-equilibrium chemical network with 21 gas-phase species plus dust
grains and 213 reactions. With this network we model the deuteration process in
fully depleted prestellar cores in great detail and determine its response to
variations in the initial conditions. We explore the dependence on the initial
gas column density, the turbulent Mach number, the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio
and the distribution of the magnetic field, as well as the initial
ortho-to-para ratio of H2. We find excellent agreement with recent observations
of deuterium fractions in quiescent sources. Our results show that deuteration
is rather efficient, even when assuming a conservative ortho-to-para ratio of 3
and highly sub-virial initial conditions, leading to large deuterium fractions
already within roughly a free-fall time. We discuss the implications of our
results and give an outlook to relevant future investigations.

"  The Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is a cornerstone of Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations and among the most widely used computational kernels in science.
The potential models atomistic attraction and repulsion with century old
prescribed parameters ($q=6, \; p=12$, respectively), originally related by a
factor of two for simplicity of calculations. We re-examine the value of the
repulsion exponent through data driven uncertainty quantification. We perform
Hierarchical Bayesian inference on MD simulations of argon using experimental
data of the radial distribution function (RDF) for a range of thermodynamic
conditions, as well as dimer interaction energies from quantum mechanics
simulations. The experimental data suggest a repulsion exponent ($p \approx
6.5$), in contrast to the quantum simulations data that support values closer
to the original ($p=12$) exponent. Most notably, we find that predictions of
RDF, diffusion coefficient and density of argon are more accurate and robust in
producing the correct argon phase around its triple point, when using the
values inferred from experimental data over those from quantum mechanics
simulations. The present results suggest the need for data driven recalibration
of the LJ potential across MD simulations.

"  Proxima Centauri is known as the closest star from the Sun. Recently, radial
velocity observations revealed the existence of an Earth-mass planet around it.
With an orbital period of ~11 days, the surface of Proxima Centauri b is
temperate and might be habitable. We took a photometric monitoring campaign to
search for its transit, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan
Station in Antarctica. A transit-like signal appearing on 2016 September 8th,
is identified tentatively. Its midtime, $T_{C}=2,457,640.1990\pm0.0017$ HJD, is
consistent with the predicted ephemeris based on RV orbit in a 1$\sigma$
confidence interval. Time-correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of
Proxima Centauri, affecting detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a
Gaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of potential
transit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here, has a confidence
level of $2.5\sigma$. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to
confirm the planetary transit of Proxima Centauri b. We plan to monitor Proxima
Centauri in next Polar night at Dome A in Antarctica, taking the advantage of
continuous darkness. \citet{Kipping17} reported two tentative transit-like
signals of Proxima Centauri b, observed by the Microvariability and Oscillation
of Stars space Telescope in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The midtransit time of
our detection is 138 minutes later than that predicted by their transit
ephemeris. If all the signals are real transits, the misalignment of the epochs
plausibly suggests transit timing variations of Proxima Centauri b induced by
an outer planet in this system.

"  Using density-functional theory calculations, we analyze the optical
absorption properties of lead (Pb)-free metal halide perovskites
(AB$^{2+}$X$_3$) and double perovskites (AB$^+$B$^{3+}$X$_6$) (A = Cs or
monovalent organic ion, B$^{2+}$ = non-Pb divalent metal, B$^+$ = monovalent
metal, B$^{3+}$ = trivalent metal, X = halogen). We show that, if B$^{2+}$ is
not Sn or Ge, Pb-free metal halide perovskites exhibit poor optical absorptions
because of their indirect bandgap nature. Among the nine possible types of
Pb-free metal halide double perovskites, six have direct bandgaps. Of these six
types, four show inversion symmetry-induced parity-forbidden or weak
transitions between band edges, making them not ideal for thin-film solar cell
application. Only one type of Pb-free double perovskite shows optical
absorption and electronic properties suitable for solar cell applications,
namely those with B$^+$ = In, Tl and B$^{3+}$ = Sb, Bi. Our results provide
important insights for designing new metal halide perovskites and double
perovskites for optoelectronic applications.

"  The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet
depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of
extra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that
transit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to
transit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature
of ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is
itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat
differential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,
traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the
temperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the
molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of
ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be
significantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report
observations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbital
period ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host star
is at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the
KELT-9b's day-side temperature to be ~4600K. This is as hot as stars of stellar
type K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus the
primary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likely
atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme
ultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,
leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet
largely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host
star.
"
"  Screened modified gravity (SMG) is a kind of scalar-tensor theory with
screening mechanisms, which can suppress the fifth force in dense regions and
allow theories to evade the solar system and laboratory tests. In this paper,
we investigate how the screening mechanisms in SMG affect the gravitational
radiation damping effects, calculate in detail the rate of the energy loss due
to the emission of tensor and scalar gravitational radiations, and derive their
contributions to the change in the orbital period of the binary system. We find
that the scalar radiation depends on the screened parameters and the
propagation speed of scalar waves, and the scalar dipole radiation dominates
the orbital decay of the binary system. For strongly self-gravitating bodies,
all effects of scalar sector are strongly suppressed by the screening
mechanisms in SMG. By comparing our results to observations of binary system
PSR J1738+0333, we place the stringent constraints on the screening mechanisms
in SMG. As an application of these results, we focus on three specific models
of SMG (chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton), and derive the constraints on the
model parameters, respectively.

"  In the framework of multi-body dynamics, successive encounters with a third
body, even if well outside of its sphere of influence, can noticeably alter the
trajectory of a spacecraft. Examples of these effects have already been
exploited by past missions such as SMART-1, as well as are proposed to benefit
future missions to Jupiter, Saturn or Neptune, and disposal strategies from
Earth's High Eccentric or Libration Point Orbits. This paper revises three
totally different descriptions of the effects of the third body gravitational
perturbation. These are the averaged dynamics of the classical third body
perturbing function, the Opik's close encounter theory and the Keplerian map
approach. The first two techniques have respectively been applied to the cases
of a spacecraft either always remaining very far or occasionally experiencing
extremely close approaches to the third body. However, the paper also seeks
solutions for trajectories that undergo one or more close approaches at
distances in the order of the sphere of influence of the third body. The paper
attempts to gain insight into the accuracy of these different perturbative
techniques into each of these scenarios, as compared with the motion in the
Circular Restricted Three Body Problem.

"  The effects of MHD boundary layer flow of non-linear thermal radiation with
convective heat transfer and non-uniform heat source/sink in presence of
thermophortic velocity and chemical reaction investigated in this study.
Suitable similarity transformation are used to solve the partial ordinary
differential equation of considered governing flow. Runge-Kutta fourth fifth
order Fehlberg method with shooting techniques are used to solved
non-dimensional governing equations. The variation of different parameters such
as thermophoretic parameter, chemical reaction parameter, non- uniform heat
source/sink parameters are studied on velocity, temperature and concentration
profiles, and are described by suitable graphs and tables. The obtained results
are in very well agreement with previous results.

"  The collective magnetic excitations in the spin-orbit Mott insulator
(Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$)$_2$IrO$_4$ ($x=0,\,0.01,\,0.04,\, 0.1$) were investigated by
means of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. We report significant magnon
energy gaps at both the crystallographic and antiferromagnetic zone centers at
all doping levels, along with a remarkably pronounced momentum-dependent
lifetime broadening. The spin-wave gap is accounted for by a significant
anisotropy in the interactions between $J_\text{eff}=1/2$ isospins, thus
marking the departure of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ from the essentially isotropic
Heisenberg model appropriate for the superconducting cuprates.

"  We report the proximity induced anomalous transport behavior in a Nb
Bi1.95Sb0.05Se3 heterostructure. Mechanically Exfoliated single crystal of
Bi1.95Sb0.05Se3 topological insulator (TI) is partially covered with a 100 nm
thick Niobium superconductor using DC magnetron sputtering by shadow masking
technique. The magnetotransport (MR) measurements have been performed
simultaneously on the TI sample with and without Nb top layer in the
temperature,T, range of 3 to 8 K, and a magnetic field B up to 15 T. MR on TI
region shows Subnikov de Haas oscillation at fields greater than 5 T. Anomalous
linear change in resistance is observed in the field range of negative 4T to
positive 4T at which Nb is superconducting. At 0 T field, the temperature
dependence of resistance on the Nb covered region revealed a superconducting
transition (TC) at 8.2 K, whereas TI area showed similar TC with the absence of
zero resistance states due to the additional resistance from superconductor
(SC) TI interface. Interestingly below the TC the R vs T measured on TI showed
an enhancement in resistance for positive field and prominent fall in
resistance for negative field direction. This indicates the directional
dependent scattering of the Cooper pairs on the surface of the TI due to the
superposition of spin singlet and triplet states in the superconductor and TI
respectively.

"  Conventional crystalline magnets are characterized by symmetry breaking and
normal modes of excitation called magnons with quantized angular momentum
$\hbar$. Neutron scattering correspondingly features extra magnetic Bragg
diffraction at low temperatures and dispersive inelastic scattering associated
with single magnon creation and annihilation. Exceptions are anticipated in
so-called quantum spin liquids as exemplified by the one-dimensional spin-1/2
chain which has no magnetic order and where magnons accordingly fractionalize
into spinons with angular momentum $\hbar/2$. This is spectacularly revealed by
a continuum of inelastic neutron scattering associated with two-spinon
processes and the absence of magnetic Bragg diffraction. Here, we report
evidence for these same key features of a quantum spin liquid in the
three-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$. Through specific
heat and neutron scattering measurements, Monte Carlo simulations, and analytic
approximations to the equal time correlations, we show that NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is
an almost ideal realization of the spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on
a pyrochlore lattice with weak connectivity and frustrated interactions.
Magnetic Bragg diffraction is absent and 90\% of the spectral weight forms a
continuum of magnetic scattering not dissimilar to that of the spin-1/2 chain
but with low energy pinch points indicating NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is in a Coulomb
phase. The residual entropy and diffuse elastic scattering points to an exotic
state of matter driven by frustration, quantum fluctuations and weak exchange
disorder.

"  We introduce the new version of SimProp, a Monte Carlo code for simulating
the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in intergalactic space. This
version, SimProp v2r4, together with an overall improvement of the code
capabilities with a substantial reduction in the computation time, also
computes secondary cosmogenic particles such as electron-positron pairs and
gamma rays produced during the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. As
recently pointed out by several authors, the flux of this secondary radiation
and its products, within reach of the current observatories, provides useful
information about models of ultra-high energy cosmic ray sources which would be
hard to discriminate otherwise.
"
"  Muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools would serve to verify the
simulated muon fluxes and offer the possibility of studying cosmic muons in
general. This reconstruction is, however, complicated by many optical obstacles
and the small coverage of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as compared to other
large water Cherenkov detectors. The PMTs' timing information is useful only in
the case of direct, unreflected Cherenkov light. This requires PMTs to be added
and removed as an hypothesized muon trajectory is iteratively improved, to
account for the changing effects of obstacles and direction of light.
Therefore, muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools does not lend itself
to a general fitting procedure employing smoothly varying functions with
continuous derivatives. Here, an algorithm is described which overcomes these
complications. It employs the method of Least Mean Squares to determine an
hypothesized trajectory from the PMTs' charge-weighted positions. This
initially hypothesized trajectory is then iteratively refined using the PMTs'
timing information. Reconstructions with simulated data reproduce the simulated
trajectory to within about 5 degrees in direction and about 45 cm in position
at the pool surface, with a bias that tends to pull tracks away from the
vertical by about 3 degrees.

"  We extend a data-based model-free multifractal method of exoplanet detection
to probe exoplanetary atmospheres. Whereas the transmission spectrum is studied
during the primary eclipse, we analyze the emission spectrum during the
secondary eclipse, thereby probing the atmospheric limb. In addition to the
spectral structure of exoplanet atmospheres, the approach provides information
to study phenomena such as atmospheric flows, tidal-locking behavior, and the
dayside-nightside redistribution of energy. The approach is demonstrated using
Spitzer data for exoplanet HD189733b. The central advantage of the method is
the lack of model assumptions in the detection and observational schemes.
"
"  Telescopes based on the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique (IACTs)
detect images of the atmospheric showers generated by gamma rays and cosmic
rays as they are absorbed by the atmosphere. The much more frequent cosmic-ray
events form the main background when looking for gamma-ray sources, and
therefore IACT sensitivity is significantly driven by the capability to
distinguish between these two types of events. Supervised learning algorithms,
like random forests and boosted decision trees, have been shown to effectively
classify IACT events. In this contribution we present results from exploratory
work using deep learning as an event classification method for the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA). CTA, conceived as an array of tens of IACTs, is an
international project for a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory,
aiming to improve on the sensitivity of current-generation experiments by an
order of magnitude and provide energy coverage from 20 GeV to more than 300
TeV.

"  Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as promising
two-dimensional (2d) semiconductors for optoelectronic and flexible devices.
However, a microscopic explanation of their photophysics -- of pivotal
importance for the understanding and optimization of device operation -- is
still lacking. Here we use femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, with
pump pulse tunability and broadband probing, to monitor the relaxation dynamics
of single-layer MoS2 over the entire visible range, upon photoexcitation of
different excitonic transitions. We find that, irrespective of excitation
photon energy, the transient absorption spectrum shows the simultaneous
bleaching of all excitonic transitions and corresponding red-shifted
photoinduced absorption bands. First-principle modeling of the ultrafast
optical response reveals that a transient bandgap renormalization, caused by
the presence of photo-excited carriers, is primarily responsible for the
observed features. Our results demonstrate the strong impact of many-body
effects in the transient optical response of TMDs even in the
low-excitation-density regime.
"
"  We study special circle bundles over two elementary moduli spaces of
meromorphic quadratic differentials with real periods denoted by $\mathcal
Q_0^{\mathbb R}(-7)$ and $\mathcal Q^{\mathbb R}_0([-3]^2)$. The space
$\mathcal Q_0^{\mathbb R}(-7)$ is the moduli space of meromorphic quadratic
differentials on the Riemann sphere with one pole of order 7 with real periods;
it appears naturally in the study of a neighbourhood of the Witten's cycle
$W_1$ in the combinatorial model based on Jenkins-Strebel quadratic
differentials of $\mathcal M_{g,n}$. The space $\mathcal Q^{\mathbb
R}_0([-3]^2)$ is the moduli space of meromorphic quadratic differentials on the
Riemann sphere with two poles of order at most 3 with real periods; it appears
in description of a neighbourhood of Kontsevich's boundary $W_{-1,-1}$ of the
combinatorial model. The application of the formalism of the Bergman
tau-function to the combinatorial model (with the goal of computing
analytically Poincare dual cycles to certain combinations of tautological
classes) requires the study of special sections of circle bundles over
$\mathcal Q_0^{\mathbb R}(-7)$ and $\mathcal Q^{\mathbb R}_0([-3]^2)$; in the
case of the space $\mathcal Q_0^{\mathbb R}(-7)$ a section of this circle
bundle is given by the argument of the modular discriminant. We study the
spaces $\mathcal Q_0^{\mathbb R}(-7)$ and $\mathcal Q^{\mathbb R}_0([-3]^2)$,
also called the spaces of Boutroux curves, in detail, together with
corresponding circle bundles.
"
"  We report a method to control the positions of ellipsoidal magnets in flowing
channels of rectangular or circular cross section at low Reynolds number.A
static uniform magnetic field is used to pin the particle orientation, and the
particles move with translational drift velocities resulting from hydrodynamic
interactions with the channel walls which can be described using Blake's image
tensor.Building on his insights, we are able to present a far-field theory
predicting the particle motion in rectangular channels, and validate the
accuracy of the theory by comparing to numerical solutions using the boundary
element method.We find that, by changing the direction of the applied magnetic
field, the motion can be controlled so that particles move either to a curved
focusing region or to the channel walls.We also use simulations to show that
the particles are focused to a single line in a circular channel.Our results
suggest ways to focus and segregate magnetic particles in lab-on-a-chip
devices.
"
"  A two-dimensional bidisperse granular fluid is shown to exhibit pronounced
long-ranged dynamical heterogeneities as dynamical arrest is approached. Here
we focus on the most direct approach to study these heterogeneities: we
identify clusters of slow particles and determine their size, $N_c$, and their
radius of gyration, $R_G$. We show that $N_c\propto R_G^{d_f}$, providing
direct evidence that the most immobile particles arrange in fractal objects
with a fractal dimension, $d_f$, that is observed to increase with packing
fraction $\phi$. The cluster size distribution obeys scaling, approaching an
algebraic decay in the limit of structural arrest, i.e., $\phi\to\phi_c$.
Alternatively, dynamical heterogeneities are analyzed via the four-point
structure factor $S_4(q,t)$ and the dynamical susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$.
$S_4(q,t)$ is shown to obey scaling in the full range of packing fractions,
$0.6\leq\phi\leq 0.805$, and to become increasingly long-ranged as
$\phi\to\phi_c$. Finite size scaling of $\chi_4(t)$ provides a consistency
check for the previously analyzed divergences of $\chi_4(t)\propto
(\phi-\phi_c)^{-\gamma_{\chi}}$ and the correlation length $\xi\propto
(\phi-\phi_c)^{-\gamma_{\xi}}$. We check the robustness of our results with
respect to our definition of mobility. The divergences and the scaling for
$\phi\to\phi_c$ suggest a non-equilibrium glass transition which seems
qualitatively independent of the coefficient of restitution.

"  Chemical or enzymatic cross-linking of casein micelles (CMs) increases their
stability against dissociating agents. In this paper, a comparative study of
stability between native CMs and CMs cross-linked with genipin (CMs-GP) as a
function of pH is described. Stability to temperature and ethanol were
investigated in the pH range 2.0-7.0. The size and the charge
($\zeta$-potential) of the particles were determined by dynamic light
scattering. Native CMs precipitated below pH 5.5, CMs-GP precipitated from pH
3.5 to 4.5, whereas no precipitation was observed at pH 2.0-3.0 or pH 4.5-7.0.
The isoelectric point of CMs-GP was determined to be pH 3.7. Highest stability
against heat and ethanol was observed for CMs-GP at pH 2, where visible
coagulation was determined only after 800 s at 140 $^\circ$C or 87.5% (v/v) of
ethanol. These results confirmed the hypothesis that cross-linking by GP
increased the stability of CMs.
"
"  Predicting when rupture occurs or cracks progress is a major challenge in
numerous elds of industrial, societal and geophysical importance. It remains
largely unsolved: Stress enhancement at cracks and defects, indeed, makes the
macroscale dynamics extremely sensitive to the microscale material disorder.
This results in giant statistical uctuations and non-trivial behaviors upon
upscaling dicult to assess via the continuum approaches of engineering. These
issues are examined here. We will see: How linear elastic fracture mechanics
sidetracks the diculty by reducing the problem to that of the propagation of a
single crack in an eective material free of defects, How slow cracks sometimes
display jerky dynamics, with sudden violent events incompatible with the
previous approach, and how some paradigms of statistical physics can explain
it, How abnormally fast cracks sometimes emerge due to the formation of
microcracks at very small scales.
"
"  We show how a characteristic length scale imprinted in the galaxy two-point
correlation function, dubbed the ""linear point"", can serve as a comoving
cosmological standard ruler. In contrast to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
peak location, this scale is constant in redshift and is unaffected by
non-linear effects to within $0.5$ percent precision. We measure the location
of the linear point in the galaxy correlation function of the LOWZ and CMASS
samples from the Twelfth Data Release (DR12) of the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) collaboration. We combine our linear-point
measurement with cosmic-microwave-background constraints from the Planck
satellite to estimate the isotropic-volume distance $D_{V}(z)$, without relying
on a model-template or reconstruction method. We find $D_V(0.32)=1264\pm 28$
Mpc and $D_V(0.57)=2056\pm 22$ Mpc respectively, consistent with the quoted
values from the BOSS collaboration. This remarkable result suggests that all
the distance information contained in the baryon acoustic oscillations can be
conveniently compressed into the single length associated with the linear
point.
"
"  We report the measurements of de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations in the
noncentrosymmetric superconductor BiPd. Several pieces of a complex multi-sheet
Fermi surface are identified, including a small pocket (frequency 40 T) which
is three dimensional and anisotropic. From the temperature dependence of the
amplitude of the oscillations, the cyclotron effective mass is ($0.18$ $\pm$
0.1) $m_e$. Further analysis showed a non-trivial $\pi$-Berry phase is
associated with the 40 T pocket, which strongly supports the presence of
topological states in bulk BiPd and may result in topological superconductivity
due to the proximity coupling to other bands.

"  High-pressure neutron powder diffraction, muon-spin rotation and
magnetization studies of the structural, magnetic and the superconducting
properties of the Ce-underdoped superconducting (SC) electron-doped cuprate
system T'-Pr_1.3-xLa_0.7Ce_xCuO_4 with x = 0.1 are reported. A strong reduction
of the lattice constants a and c is observed under pressure. However, no
indication of any pressure induced phase transition from T' to T structure is
observed up to the maximum applied pressure of p = 11 GPa. Large and non-linear
increase of the short-range magnetic order temperature T_so in
T'-Pr_1.3-xLa_0.7Ce_xCuO_4 (x = 0.1) was observed under pressure.
Simultaneously pressure causes a non-linear decrease of the SC transition
temperature T_c. All these experiments establish the short-range magnetic order
as an intrinsic and a new competing phase in SC T'-Pr_1.2La_0.7Ce_0.1CuO_4. The
observed pressure effects may be interpreted in terms of the improved nesting
conditions through the reduction of the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice
constants upon hydrostatic pressure.
"
"  The KdV equation can be derived in the shallow water limit of the Euler
equations. Over the last few decades, this equation has been extended to
include higher order effects. Although this equation has only one conservation
law, exact periodic and solitonic solutions exist. Khare and Saxena
\cite{KhSa,KhSa14,KhSa15} demonstrated the possibility of generating new exact
solutions by combining known ones for several fundamental equations (e.g.,
Korteweg - de Vries, Nonlinear Schrödinger). Here we find that this
construction can be repeated for higher order, non-integrable extensions of
these equations. Contrary to many statements in the literature, there seems to
be no correlation between integrability and the number of nonlinear one
variable wave solutions.
"
"  Molecular reflections on usual wall surfaces can be statistically described
by the Maxwell diffuse reflection model, which has been successfully applied in
the DSBGK simulations. We develop the DSBGK algorithm to implement the
Cercignani-Lampis-Lord (CLL) reflection model, which is widely applied to
polished surfaces and used particularly in modeling space shuttles to predict
the heat and force loads exerted by the high-speed flows around the surfaces.
We also extend the DSBGK method to simulate gas mixtures and high contrast of
number densities of different components can be handled at a cost of memory
usage much lower than that needed by the DSMC simulations because the average
numbers of simulated molecules of different components per cell can be equal in
the DSBGK simulations.
"
"  Using holography, we model experiments in which a 2+1D strange metal is
pumped by a laser pulse into a highly excited state, after which the time
evolution of the optical conductivity is probed. We consider a finite-density
state with mildly broken translation invariance and excite it by oscillating
electric field pulses. At zero density, the optical conductivity would assume
its thermalized value immediately after the pumping has ended. At finite
density, pulses with significant DC components give rise to slow exponential
relaxation, governed by a vector quasinormal mode. In contrast, for
high-frequency pulses the amplitude of the quasinormal mode is strongly
suppressed, so that the optical conductivity assumes its thermalized value
effectively instantaneously. This surprising prediction may provide a stimulus
for taking up the challenge to realize these experiments in the laboratory.
Such experiments would test a crucial open question faced by applied
holography: Are its predictions artefacts of the large $N$ limit or do they
enjoy sufficient UV independence to hold at least qualitatively in real-world
systems?
"
"  In this paper, an enthalpy-based multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice
Boltzmann (LB) method is developed for solid-liquid phase change heat transfer
in metal foams under local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) condition. The
enthalpy-based MRT-LB method consists of three different MRT-LB models: one for
flow field based on the generalized non-Darcy model, and the other two for
phase change material (PCM) and metal foam temperature fields described by the
LTNE model. The moving solid-liquid phase interface is implicitly tracked
through the liquid fraction, which is simultaneously obtained when the energy
equations of PCM and metal foam are solved. The present method has several
distinctive features. First, as compared with previous studies, the present
method avoids the iteration procedure, thus it retains the inherent merits of
the standard LB method and is superior over the iteration method in terms of
accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, a volumetric LB scheme instead
of the bounce-back scheme is employed to realize the no-slip velocity condition
in the interface and solid phase regions, which is consistent with the actual
situation. Last but not least, the MRT collision model is employed, and with
additional degrees of freedom, it has the ability to reduce the numerical
diffusion across phase interface induced by solid-liquid phase change.
Numerical tests demonstrate that the present method can be served as an
accurate and efficient numerical tool for studying metal foam enhanced
solid-liquid phase change heat transfer in latent heat storage. Finally,
comparisons and discussions are made to offer useful information for practical
applications of the present method.

"  Barchan dunes are crescentic shape dunes with horns pointing downstream. The
present paper reports the formation of subaqueous barchan dunes from initially
conical heaps in a rectangular channel. Because the most unique feature of a
barchan dune is its horns, we associate the timescale for the appearance of
horns to the formation of a barchan dune. A granular heap initially conical was
placed on the bottom wall of a closed conduit and it was entrained by a water
flow in turbulent regime. After a certain time, horns appear and grow, until an
equilibrium length is reached. Our results show the existence of the timescales
$0.5t_c$ and $2.5t_c$ for the appearance and equilibrium of horns,
respectively, where $t_c$ is a characteristic time that scales with the grains
diameter, gravity acceleration, densities of the fluid and grains, and shear
and threshold velocities.
"
"  The increasing number of protein-based metamaterials demands reliable and
efficient methods to study the physicochemical properties they may display. In
this regard, we develop a simulation strategy based on Molecular Dynamics (MD)
that addresses the geometric degrees of freedom of an auxetic two-dimensional
protein crystal. This model consists of a network of impenetrable rigid squares
linked through massless rigid rods, thus featuring a large number of both
holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. Our MD methodology is optimized to
study highly constrained systems and allows for the simulation of long-time
dynamics with reasonably large timesteps. The data extracted from the
simulations shows a persistent motional interdependence among the protein
subunits in the crystal. We characterize the dynamical correlations featured by
these subunits and identify two regimes characterized by their locality or
nonlocality, depending on the geometric parameters of the crystal. From the
same data, we also calculate the Poisson\rq{}s (longitudinal to axial strain)
ratio of the crystal, and learn that, due to holonomic constraints (rigidness
of the rod links), the crystal remains auxetic even after significant changes
in the original geometry. The nonholonomic ones (collisions between subunits)
increase the number of inhomogeneous deformations of the crystal, thus driving
it away from an isotropic response. Our work provides the first simulation of
the dynamics of protein crystals and offers insights into promising mechanical
properties afforded by these materials.
"
"  In this work, we present an experimental study of spin mediated enhanced
negative magnetoresistance in Ni80Fe20 (50 nm)/p-Si (350 nm) bilayer. The
resistance measurement shows a reduction of ~2.5% for the bilayer specimen as
compared to 1.3% for Ni80Fe20 (50 nm) on oxide specimen for an out-of-plane
applied magnetic field of 3T. In the Ni80Fe20-only film, the negative
magnetoresistance behavior is attributed to anisotropic magnetoresistance. We
propose that spin polarization due to spin-Hall effect is the underlying cause
of the enhanced negative magnetoresistance observed in the bilayer. Silicon has
weak spin orbit coupling so spin Hall magnetoresistance measurement is not
feasible. We use V2{\omega} and V3{\omega} measurement as a function of
magnetic field and angular rotation of magnetic field in direction normal to
electric current to elucidate the spin-Hall effect. The angular rotation of
magnetic field shows a sinusoidal behavior for both V2{\omega} and V3{\omega},
which is attributed to the spin phonon interactions resulting from the
spin-Hall effect mediated spin polarization. We propose that the spin
polarization leads to a decrease in hole-phonon scattering resulting in
enhanced negative magnetoresistance.
"
"  The statistical behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue has important
implications for systems which can be modeled using a Wishart-Laguerre
ensemble, the regular one or the fixed trace one. For example, the density of
the smallest eigenvalue of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble plays a crucial role
in characterizing multiple channel telecommunication systems. Similarly, in the
quantum entanglement problem, the smallest eigenvalue of the fixed trace
ensemble carries information regarding the nature of entanglement.
For real Wishart-Laguerre matrices, there exists an elegant recurrence scheme
suggested by Edelman to directly obtain the exact expression for the smallest
eigenvalue density. In the case of complex Wishart-Laguerre matrices, for
finding exact and explicit expressions for the smallest eigenvalue density,
existing results based on determinants become impractical when the determinants
involve large-size matrices. In this work, we derive a recurrence scheme for
the complex case which is analogous to that of Edelman's for the real case.
This is used to obtain exact results for the smallest eigenvalue density for
both the regular, and the fixed trace complex Wishart-Laguerre ensembles. We
validate our analytical results using Monte Carlo simulations. We also study
scaled Wishart-Laguerre ensemble and investigate its efficacy in approximating
the fixed-trace ensemble. Eventually, we apply our result for the fixed-trace
ensemble to investigate the behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue in the
paradigmatic system of coupled kicked tops.

"  Numerical simulations of the G.O. Roberts dynamo are presented. Dynamos both
with and without a significant mean field are obtained. Exact bounds are
derived for the total energy which conform with the Kolmogorov phenomenology of
turbulence. Best fits to numerical data show the same functional dependences as
the inequalities obtained from optimum theory.
"
"  Given the importance of crystal symmetry for the emergence of topological
quantum states, we have studied, as exemplified in NbNiTe2, the interplay of
crystal symmetry, atomic displacements (lattice vibration), band degeneracy,
and band topology. For NbNiTe2 structure in space group 53 (Pmna) - having an
inversion center arising from two glide planes and one mirror plane with a
2-fold rotation and screw axis - a full gap opening exists between two band
manifolds near the Fermi energy. Upon atomic displacements by optical phonons,
the symmetry lowers to space group 28 (Pma2), eliminating one glide plane along
c, the associated rotation and screw axis, and the inversion center. As a
result, twenty Weyl points emerge, including four type-II Weyl points in the
G-X direction at the boundary between a pair of adjacent electron and hole
bands. Thus, optical phonons may offer control of the transition to a Weyl
fermion state.
"
"  The turbulent Rayleigh--Taylor system in a rotating reference frame is
investigated by direct numerical simulations within the Oberbeck-Boussinesq
approximation. On the basis of theoretical arguments, supported by our
simulations, we show that the Rossby number decreases in time, and therefore
the Coriolis force becomes more important as the system evolves and produces
many effects on Rayleigh--Taylor turbulence. We find that rotation reduces the
intensity of turbulent velocity fluctuations and therefore the growth rate of
the temperature mixing layer. Moreover, in presence of rotation the conversion
of potential energy into turbulent kinetic energy is found to be less effective
and the efficiency of the heat transfer is reduced. Finally, during the
evolution of the mixing layer we observe the development of a
cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry.
"
"  In the animal world, the competition between individuals belonging to
different species for a resource often requires the cooperation of several
individuals in groups. This paper proposes a generalization of the Hawk-Dove
Game for an arbitrary number of agents: the N-person Hawk-Dove Game. In this
model, doves exemplify the cooperative behavior without intraspecies conflict,
while hawks represent the aggressive behavior. In the absence of hawks, doves
share the resource equally and avoid conflict, but having hawks around lead to
doves escaping without fighting. Conversely, hawks fight for the resource at
the cost of getting injured. Nevertheless, if doves are present in sufficient
number to expel the hawks, they can aggregate to protect the resource, and thus
avoid being plundered by hawks. We derive and numerically solve an exact
equation for the evolution of the system in both finite and infinite well-mixed
populations, finding the conditions for stable coexistence between both
species. Furthermore, by varying the different parameters, we found a scenario
of bifurcations that leads the system from dominating hawks and coexistence to
bi-stability, multiple interior equilibria and dominating doves.

"  Recently, heavily doped semiconductors are emerging as an alternate for low
loss plasmonic materials. InN, belonging to the group III nitrides, possesses
the unique property of surface electron accumulation (SEA) which provides two
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system. In this report, we demonstrated the
surface plasmon properties of InN nanoparticles originating from SEA using the
real space mapping of the surface plasmon fields for the first time. The SEA is
confirmed by Raman studies which are further corroborated by photoluminescence
and photoemission spectroscopic studies. The frequency of 2DEG corresponding to
SEA is found to be in the THz region. The periodic fringes are observed in the
near-field scanning optical microscopic images of InN nanostructures. The
observed fringes are attributed to the interference of propagated and back
reflected surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The observation of SPPs is solely
attributed to the 2DEG corresponding to the SEA of InN. In addition, resonance
kind of behavior with the enhancement of the near-field intensity is observed
in the near-field images of InN nanostructures. Observation of SPPs indicates
that InN with SEA can be a promising THz plasmonic material for the light
confinement.

"  It is shown that using beam splitters with non-equal wave vectors results in
a new recoil diagram which is qualitatively different from the well-known
diagram associated with the Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer. We predict a new
asymmetric Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer (AMZAI) and study it when one uses
a Raman beam splitter. The main feature is that the phase of AMZAI contains a
quantum part proportional to the recoil frequency. A response sensitive only to
the quantum phase was found. A new technique to measure the recoil frequency
and fine structure constant is proposed and studied outside of the Raman-Nath
approximation.

"  Shock wave interactions with defects, such as pores, are known to play a key
role in the chemical initiation of energetic materials. The shock response of
hexanitrostilbene is studied through a combination of large scale reactive
molecular dynamics and mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. In order to extend
our simulation capability at the mesoscale to include weak shock conditions (<
6 GPa), atomistic simulations of pore collapse are used to define a strain rate
dependent strength model. Comparing these simulation methods allows us to
impose physically-reasonable constraints on the mesoscale model parameters. In
doing so, we have been able to study shock waves interacting with pores as a
function of this viscoplastic material response. We find that the pore collapse
behavior of weak shocks is characteristically different to that of strong
shocks.

"  Strain engineering has attracted great attention, particularly for epitaxial
films grown on a different substrate. Residual strains of SiC have been widely
employed to form ultra-high frequency and high Q factor resonators. However, to
date the highest residual strain of SiC was reported to be limited to
approximately 0.6%. Large strains induced into SiC could lead to several
interesting physical phenomena, as well as significant improvement of resonant
frequencies. We report an unprecedented nano strain-amplifier structure with an
ultra-high residual strain up to 8% utilizing the natural residual stress
between epitaxial 3C SiC and Si. In addition, the applied strain can be tuned
by changing the dimensions of the amplifier structure. The possibility of
introducing such a controllable and ultra-high strain will open the door to
investigating the physics of SiC in large strain regimes, and the development
of ultra sensitive mechanical sensors.

"  A complex system can be represented and analyzed as a network, where nodes
represent the units of the network and edges represent connections between
those units. For example, a brain network represents neurons as nodes and axons
between neurons as edges. In many networks, some nodes have a
disproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges
between each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different
networks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network
integration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity
structure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a
myriad of different biological and man-made networks, we discover the diverse
club--a set of nodes that have edges diversely distributed across the network.
The diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties
consistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly
interconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global
integration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that
produces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating
that these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures.
Given the variety of different networks that we analyzed--the c. elegans, the
macaque brain, the human brain, the United States power grid, and global air
traffic--the diverse club appears to be ubiquitous in complex networks. These
results warrant the distinction and analysis of two critical clubs of nodes in
all complex systems.

"  The limitations in performance of the present RICH system in the LHCb
experiment are given by the natural chromatic dispersion of the gaseous
Cherenkov radiator, the aberrations of the optical system and the pixel size of
the photon detectors. Moreover, the overall PID performance can be affected by
high detector occupancy as the pattern recognition becomes more difficult with
high particle multiplicities. This paper shows a way to improve performance by
systematically addressing each of the previously mentioned limitations. These
ideas are applied in the present and future upgrade phases of the LHCb
experiment. Although applied to specific circumstances, they are used as a
paradigm on what is achievable in the development and realisation of high
precision RICH detectors.

"  Condensed-matter analogs of the Higgs boson in particle physics allow
insights into its behavior in different symmetries and dimensionalities.
Evidence for the Higgs mode has been reported in a number of different
settings, including ultracold atomic gases, disordered superconductors, and
dimerized quantum magnets. However, decay processes of the Higgs mode (which
are eminently important in particle physics) have not yet been studied in
condensed matter due to the lack of a suitable material system coupled to a
direct experimental probe. A quantitative understanding of these processes is
particularly important for low-dimensional systems where the Higgs mode decays
rapidly and has remained elusive to most experimental probes. Here, we discover
and study the Higgs mode in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet using
spin-polarized inelastic neutron scattering. Our spin-wave spectra of
Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ directly reveal a well-defined, dispersive Higgs mode, which
quickly decays into transverse Goldstone modes at the antiferromagnetic
ordering wavevector. Through a complete mapping of the transverse modes in the
reciprocal space, we uniquely specify the minimal model Hamiltonian and
describe the decay process. We thus establish a novel condensed matter platform
for research on the dynamics of the Higgs mode.

"  Unique among alkali-doped $\textit {A}$$_3$C$_{60}$ fullerene compounds, the
A15 and fcc forms of Cs$_3$C$_{60}$ exhibit superconducting states varying
under hydrostatic pressure with highest transition temperatures at $T_\textrm
{C}$$^\textrm {meas}$ = 38.3 and 35.2 K, respectively. Herein it is argued that
these two compounds under pressure represent the optimal materials of the
$\textit {A}$$_3$C$_{60}$ family, and that the C$_{60}$-associated
superconductivity is mediated through Coulombic interactions with charges on
the alkalis. A derivation of the interlayer Coulombic pairing model of
high-$T_\textrm {C}$ superconductivity employing non-planar geometry is
introduced, generalizing the picture of two interacting layers to an
interaction between charge reservoirs located on the C$_{60}$ and alkali ions.
The optimal transition temperature follows the algebraic expression, $T_\textrm
{C0}$ = (12.474 nm$^2$ K)/$\ell$${\zeta}$, where $\ell$ relates to the mean
spacing between interacting surface charges on the C$_{60}$ and ${\zeta}$ is
the average radial distance between the C$_{60}$ surface and the neighboring Cs
ions. Values of $T_\textrm {C0}$ for the measured cation stoichiometries of
Cs$_{3-\textrm{x}}$C$_{60}$ with x $\approx$ 0 are found to be 38.19 and 36.88
K for the A15 and fcc forms, respectively, with the dichotomy in transition
temperature reflecting the larger ${\zeta}$ and structural disorder in the fcc
form. In the A15 form, modeled interacting charges and Coulomb potential
e$^2$/${\zeta}$ are shown to agree quantitatively with findings from
nuclear-spin relaxation and mid-infrared optical conductivity. In the fcc form,
suppression of $T_\textrm {C}$$^\textrm {meas}$ below $T_\textrm {C0}$ is
ascribed to native structural disorder. Phononic effects in conjunction with
Coulombic pairing are discussed.

"  Improving the performance of superconducting qubits and resonators generally
results from a combination of materials and fabrication process improvements
and design modifications that reduce device sensitivity to residual losses. One
instance of this approach is to use trenching into the device substrate in
combination with superconductors and dielectrics with low intrinsic losses to
improve quality factors and coherence times. Here we demonstrate titanium
nitride coplanar waveguide resonators with mean quality factors exceeding two
million and controlled trenching reaching 2.2 $\mu$m into the silicon
substrate. Additionally, we measure sets of resonators with a range of sizes
and trench depths and compare these results with finite-element simulations to
demonstrate quantitative agreement with a model of interface dielectric loss.
We then apply this analysis to determine the extent to which trenching can
improve resonator performance.

"  This paper will detail changes in the operational paradigm of the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) magnetron $H^{-}$ ion source due to
upgrades in the accelerator system. Prior to November of 2012 the $H^{-}$ ions
for High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments were extracted at ~18 keV vertically
downward into a 90 degree bending magnet and accelerated through a
Cockcroft-Walton accelerating column to 750 keV. Following the upgrade in the
fall of 2012 the $H^{-}$ ions are now directly extracted from a magnetron at 35
keV and accelerated to 750 keV by a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). This
change in extraction energy as well as the orientation of the ion source
required not only a redesign of the ion source, but an updated understanding of
its operation at these new values. Discussed in detail are the changes to the
ion source timing, arc discharge current, hydrogen gas pressure, and cesium
delivery system that were needed to maintain consistent operation at >99%
uptime for HEP, with an increased ion source lifetime of over 9 months.

"  We consider the withdrawal of a ball from a fluid reservoir to understand the
longevity of the connection between that ball and the fluid it breaks away
from, at intermediate Reynolds numbers. Scaling arguments based on the
processes observed as the ball interacts with the fluid surface were applied to
the `pinch-off time', when the ball breaks its connection with the fluid from
which it has been withdrawn, measured experimentally. At the lowest Reynolds
numbers tested, pinch-off occurs in a `surface seal' close to the reservoir
surface, where at larger Reynolds numbers pinch-off occurs in an `ejecta seal'
close to the ball. Our scaling analysis shows that the connection between ball
and fluid is controlled by the fluid film draining from the ball as it
continues to be winched away from the fluid reservoir. The draining flow itself
depends on the amount of fluid coating the ball on exit from the reservoir. We
consider the possibilities that this coating was created through: a surface
tension driven Landau Levitch Derjaguin wetting of the surface; a
visco-inertial quick coating; or alternatively through the inertia of the fluid
moving with the ball through the reservoir. We show that although the pinch-off
mechanism is controlled by viscosity, the coating mechanism is governed by a
different length and timescale, dictated by the inertial added mass of the ball
when submersed.
"
"  We disentangle all the individual degrees of freedom in the quantum impurity
problem to deconstruct the Kondo singlet, both in real and energy space, by
studying the contribution of each individual free electron eigenstate. This is
a problem of two spins coupled to a bath, where the bath is formed by the
remaining conduction electrons. Being a mixed state, we resort to the
""concurrence"" to quantify entanglement. We identify ""projected natural
orbitals"" that allow us to individualize a single-particle electronic wave
function that is responsible of more than $90\%$ of the impurity screening. In
the weak coupling regime, the impurity is entangled to an electron at the Fermi
level, while in the strong coupling regime, the impurity counterintuitively
entangles mostly with the high energy electrons and disentangles completely
from the low-energy states carving a ""hole"" around the Fermi level. This
enables one to use concurrence as a pseudo order parameter to compute the
characteristic ""size"" of the Kondo cloud, beyond which electrons are are weakly
correlated to the impurity and are dominated by the physics of the boundary.
"
"  Motivated by the recently proposed parallel orbital-updating approach in real
space method, we propose a parallel orbital-updating based plane-wave basis
method for electronic structure calculations, for solving the corresponding
eigenvalue problems. In addition, we propose two new modified parallel
orbital-updating methods. Compared to the traditional plane-wave methods, our
methods allow for two-level parallelization, which is particularly interesting
for large scale parallelization. Numerical experiments show that these new
methods are more reliable and efficient for large scale calculations on modern
supercomputers

"  The particular type of four-kink multi-solitons (or quadrons) adiabatic
dynamics of the sine-Gordon equation in a model with two identical point
attracting impurities has been studied. This model can be used for describing
magnetization localized waves in multilayer ferromagnet. The quadrons structure
and properties has been numerically investigated. The cases of both large and
small distances between impurities has been viewed. The dependence of the
localized in impurity region nonlinear high-amplitude waves frequencies on the
distance between the impurities has been found. For an analytical description
of two bound localized on impurities nonlinear waves dynamics, using
perturbation theory, the system of differential equations for harmonic
oscillators with elastic link has been found. The analytical model
qualitatively describes the results of the sine-Gordon equation numerical
simulation.

"  Estimates of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, from the distance ladder and the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) differ at the $\sim$3-$\sigma$ level,
indicating a potential issue with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Interpreting this tension correctly requires a model comparison calculation
depending on not only the traditional `$n$-$\sigma$' mismatch but also the
tails of the likelihoods. Determining the form of the tails of the local $H_0$
likelihood is impossible with the standard Gaussian least-squares
approximation, as it requires using non-Gaussian distributions to faithfully
represent anchor likelihoods and model outliers in the Cepheid and supernova
(SN) populations, and simultaneous fitting of the full distance-ladder dataset
to correctly propagate uncertainties. We have developed a Bayesian hierarchical
model that describes the full distance ladder, from nearby geometric anchors
through Cepheids to Hubble-Flow SNe. This model does not rely on any
distributions being Gaussian, allowing outliers to be modeled and obviating the
need for arbitrary data cuts. Sampling from the $\sim$3000-parameter joint
posterior using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we find $H_0$ = (72.72 $\pm$ 1.67)
${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ when applied to the outlier-cleaned Riess et al.
(2016) data, and ($73.15 \pm 1.78$) ${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with SN
outliers reintroduced. Our high-fidelity sampling of the low-$H_0$ tail of the
distance-ladder likelihood allows us to apply Bayesian model comparison to
assess the evidence for deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. We set up this comparison
to yield a lower limit on the odds of the underlying model being $\Lambda$CDM
given the distance-ladder and Planck XIII (2016) CMB data. The odds against
$\Lambda$CDM are at worst 10:1 or 7:1, depending on whether the SNe outliers
are cut or modeled, or 60:1 if an approximation to the Planck Int. XLVI (2016)
likelihood is used.

"  We present possible explanations of pulsations in early B-type main sequence
stars which arise purely from the excitation of gravity modes. There are three
stars with this type of oscillations detected from the BRITE light curves:
$\kappa$ Cen, a Car, $\kappa$ Vel. We show that by changing metallicity or the
opacity profile it is possible in some models to dump pressure modes keeping
gravity modes unstable. Other possible scenario involves pulsations of a lower
mass companion.

"  The relativistic jets created by some active galactic nuclei are important
agents of AGN feedback. In spite of this, our understanding of what produces
these jets is still incomplete. X-ray observations, which can probe the
processes operating in the central regions in immediate vicinity of the
supermassive black hole, the presumed jet launching point, are potentially
particularly valuable in illuminating the jet formation process. Here, we
present the hard X-ray NuSTAR observations of the radio-loud quasar 4C 74.26 in
a joint analysis with quasi-simultaneous, soft X-ray Swift observations. Our
spectral analysis reveals a high-energy cut-off of 183$_{-35}^{+51}$ keV and
confirms the presence of ionized reflection in the source. From the average
spectrum we detect that the accretion disk is mildly recessed with an inner
radius of $R_\mathrm{in}=4-180\,R_\mathrm{g}$. However, no significant
evolution of the inner radius is seen during the three months covered by our
NuSTAR campaign. This lack of variation could mean that the jet formation in
this radio-loud quasar differs from what is observed in broad-line radio
galaxies.
"
"  We present a machine learning based information retrieval system for
astronomical observatories that tries to address user defined queries related
to an instrument. In the modern instrumentation scenario where heterogeneous
systems and talents are simultaneously at work, the ability to supply with the
right information helps speeding up the detector maintenance operations.
Enhancing the detector uptime leads to increased coincidence observation and
improves the likelihood for the detection of astrophysical signals. Besides,
such efforts will efficiently disseminate technical knowledge to a wider
audience and will help the ongoing efforts to build upcoming detectors like the
LIGO-India etc even at the design phase to foresee possible challenges. The
proposed method analyses existing documented efforts at the site to
intelligently group together related information to a query and to present it
on-line to the user. The user in response can further go into interesting links
and find already developed solutions or probable ways to address the present
situation optimally. A web application that incorporates the above idea has
been implemented and tested for LIGO Livingston, LIGO Hanford and Virgo
observatories.

"  Photoelectron yields of extruded scintillation counters with titanium dioxide
coating and embedded wavelength shifting fibers read out by silicon
photomultipliers have been measured at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility using
120\,GeV protons. The yields were measured as a function of transverse,
longitudinal, and angular positions for a variety of scintillator compositions
and reflective coating mixtures, fiber diameters, and photosensor sizes. Timing
performance was also studied. These studies were carried out by the Cosmic Ray

"  We report a precise measurement of hyperfine structure in the $ \rm

is excited from the ground $ \rm {2\,S_{1/2}} $ state (which has the same
parity) using two single-photon transitions via the intermediate $ \rm
{2\,P_{3/2}} $ state. The value of the hyperfine constant we measure is $ A =
93.095(52)$ MHz, which resolves two discrepant values reported in the
literature measured using other techniques. Our value is also consistent with
theoretical calculations.

"  The discovery of 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua) has provided the first glimpse of a
planetesimal born in another planetary system. This interloper exhibits a
variable colour within a range that is broadly consistent with local small
bodies such as the P/D type asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and dynamically excited
Kuiper Belt Objects. 1I/'Oumuamua appears unusually elongated in shape, with an
axial ratio exceeding 5:1. Rotation period estimates are inconsistent and
varied, with reported values between 6.9 and 8.3 hours. Here we analyse all
available optical photometry reported to date. No single rotation period can
explain the exhibited brightness variations. Rather, 1I/'Oumuamua appears to be
in an excited rotational state undergoing Non-Principal Axis (NPA) rotation, or
tumbling. A satisfactory solution has apparent lightcurve frequencies of 0.135
and 0.126 hr-1 and implies a longest-to-shortest axis ratio of 5:1, though the
available data are insufficient to uniquely constrain the true frequencies and
shape. Assuming a body that responds to NPA rotation in a similar manner to
Solar System asteroids and comets, the timescale to damp 1I/'Oumuamua's
tumbling is at least a billion years. 1I/'Oumuamua was likely set tumbling
within its parent planetary system, and will remain tumbling well after it has
left ours.

"  Many complex systems share two characteristics: 1) they are stochastic in
nature, and 2) they are characterized by a large number of factors. At the same
time, various natural complex systems appear to have two types of intertwined
constituents that exhibit counteracting effects on their equilibrium. In this
study, we employ these few characteristics to lay the groundwork for analyzing
such complex systems. The equilibrium point of these systems is generally
studied either through the kinetic notion of equilibrium or its energetic
notion, but not both. We postulate that these systems attempt to regulate the
state vector of their constituents such that both the kinetic and the energetic
notions of equilibrium are met. Based on this postulate, we prove: 1) the
existence of a point such that the kinetic notion of equilibrium is met for the
less abundant constituents and, at the same time, the state vector of more
abundant entities is regulated to minimize the energetic notion of equilibrium;
2) the effect of unboundedly increasing less (more) abundant constituents
stabilizes (destabilizes) the system; and 3) the (unrestricted) equilibrium of
the system is the point at which the number of stabilizing and destabilizing
entities increase unboundedly with the same rate.

"  Even- and odd-frequency superconductivity coexist due to broken time-reversal
symmetry under magnetic field. In order to describe this mixing, we extend the
linearized Eliashberg equation for the spin and charge fluctuation mechanism in
strongly correlated electron systems. We apply this extended Eliashberg
equation to the odd-frequency superconductivity on a quasi-one-dimensional
isosceles triangular lattice under in-plane magnetic field and examine the
effect of the even-frequency component.
"
"  We study the ultimate bounds on the estimation of temperature for an
interacting quantum system. We consider two coupled bosonic modes that are
assumed to be thermal and using quantum estimation theory establish the role
the Hamiltonian parameters play in thermometry. We show that in the case of a
conserved particle number the interaction between the modes leads to a decrease
in the overall sensitivity to temperature, while interestingly, if particle
exchange is allowed with the thermal bath the converse is true. We explain this
dichotomy by examining the energy spectra. Finally, we devise experimentally
implementable thermometry schemes that rely only on locally accessible
information from the total system, showing that almost Heisenberg limited
precision can still be achieved, and we address the (im)possibility for
multiparameter estimation in the system.

"  The center-of-mass motion of a single optically levitated nanoparticle
resembles three uncoupled harmonic oscillators. We show how a suitable
modulation of the optical trapping potential can give rise to a coupling
between two of these oscillators, such that their dynamics are governed by a
classical equation of motion that resembles the Schrödinger equation for a
two-level system. Based on experimental data, we illustrate the dynamics of
this parametrically coupled system both in the frequency and in the time
domain. We discuss the limitations and differences of the mechanical analogue
in comparison to a true quantum mechanical system.

"  In this paper, we empirically study models for pricing Italian sovereign
bonds under a reduced form framework, by assuming different dynamics for the
short-rate process. We analyze classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Vasicek
multi-factor models, with a focus on optimization algorithms applied in the
calibration exercise. The Kalman filter algorithm together with a maximum
likelihood estimation method are considered to fit the Italian term-structure
over a 12-year horizon, including the global financial crisis and the euro area
sovereign debt crisis. Analytic formulas for the gradient vector and the
Hessian matrix of the likelihood function are provided.

"  This paper re-investigates the estimation of multiple factor models relaxing
the convention that the number of factors is small and using a new approach for
identifying factors. We first obtain the collection of all possible factors and
then provide a simultaneous test, security by security, of which factors are
significant. Since the collection of risk factors is large and highly
correlated, high-dimension methods (including the LASSO and prototype
clustering) have to be used. The multi-factor model is shown to have a
significantly better fit than the Fama-French 5-factor model. Robustness tests
are also provided.

"  The paper proposes an expanded version of the Local Variance Gamma model of
Carr and Nadtochiy by adding drift to the governing underlying process. Still
in this new model it is possible to derive an ordinary differential equation
for the option price which plays a role of Dupire's equation for the standard
local volatility model. It is shown how calibration of multiple smiles (the
whole local volatility surface) can be done in such a case. Further, assuming
the local variance to be a piecewise linear function of strike and piecewise
constant function of time this ODE is solved in closed form in terms of
Confluent hypergeometric functions. Calibration of the model to market smiles
does not require solving any optimization problem and, in contrast, can be done
term-by-term by solving a system of non-linear algebraic equations for each
maturity, which is fast.

"  All people have to make risky decisions in everyday life. And we do not know
how true they are. But is it possible to mathematically assess the correctness
of our choice? This article discusses the model of decision making under risk
on the example of project management. This is a game with two players, one of
which is Investor, and the other is the Project Manager. Each player makes a
risky decision for himself, based on his past experience. With the help of a
mathematical model, the players form a level of confidence, depending on who
the player accepts the strategy or does not accept. The project manager
assesses the costs and compares them with the level of confidence. An investor
evaluates past results. Also visit the case where the strategy of the player

"  This paper considers a time-inconsistent stopping problem in which the
inconsistency arises from non-constant time preference rates. We show that the
smooth pasting principle, the main approach that has been used to construct
explicit solutions for conventional time-consistent optimal stopping problems,
may fail under time-inconsistency. Specifically, we prove that the smooth
pasting principle solves a time-inconsistent problem within the intra-personal
game theoretic framework if and only if a certain inequality on the model
primitives is satisfied. We show that the violation of this inequality can
happen even for very simple non-exponential discount functions. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the stopping problem does not admit any intra-personal
equilibrium whenever the smooth pasting principle fails. The ""negative"" results
in this paper caution blindly extending the classical approaches for
time-consistent stopping problems to their time-inconsistent counterparts.

"  We propose factor models for the cross-section of daily cryptoasset returns
and provide source code for data downloads, computing risk factors and

cryptocurrencies and a host of various other digital assets (coins and tokens)
for which exchange market data is available. Based on our empirical analysis,
we identify the leading factor that appears to strongly contribute into daily
cryptoasset returns. Our results suggest that cross-sectional statistical
arbitrage trading may be possible for cryptoassets subject to efficient

"  We investigate the predictability of several range-based stock volatility
estimators, and compare them to the standard close-to-close estimator which is
most commonly acknowledged as the volatility. The patterns of volatility
changes are analyzed using LSTM recurrent neural networks, which are a state of
the art method of sequence learning. We implement the analysis on all current
constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, and report averaged
evaluation results. We find that changes in the values of range-based
estimators are more predictable than that of the estimator using daily closing
values only.

"  Using the Panama Papers, we show that the beginning of media reporting on
expropriations and property confiscations in a country increases the
probability that offshore entities are incorporated by agents from the same
country in the same month. This result is robust to the use of country-year
fixed effects and the exclusion of tax havens. Further analysis shows that the
effect is driven by countries with non-corrupt and effective governments, which
supports the notion that offshore entities are incorporated when reasonably
well-intended and well-functioning governments become more serious about
fighting organized crime by confiscating proceeds of crime.

"  This paper presents a simple agent-based model of an economic system,
populated by agents playing different games according to their different view
about social cohesion and tax payment. After a first set of simulations,
correctly replicating results of existing literature, a wider analysis is
presented in order to study the effects of a dynamic-adaptation rule, in which
citizens may possibly decide to modify their individual tax compliance
according to individual criteria, such as, the strength of their ethical
commitment, the satisfaction gained by consumption of the public good and the
perceived opinion of neighbors. Results show the presence of thresholds levels
in the composition of society - between taxpayers and evaders - which explain
the extent of damages deriving from tax evasion.

"  Interbank markets are often characterised in terms of a core-periphery
network structure, with a highly interconnected core of banks holding the
market together, and a periphery of banks connected mostly to the core but not
internally. This paradigm has recently been challenged for short time scales,
where interbank markets seem better characterised by a bipartite structure with
more core-periphery connections than inside the core. Using a novel
core-periphery detection method on the eMID interbank market, we enrich this
picture by showing that the network is actually characterised by multiple
core-periphery pairs. Moreover, a transition from core-periphery to bipartite
structures occurs by shortening the temporal scale of data aggregation. We
further show how the global financial crisis transformed the market, in terms
of composition, multiplicity and internal organisation of core-periphery pairs.
By unveiling such a fine-grained organisation and transformation of the
interbank market, our method can find important applications in the
understanding of how distress can propagate over financial networks.

"  We consider a fundamental integer programming (IP) model for cost-benefit
analysis flood protection through dike building in the Netherlands, due to
Verweij and Zwaneveld.
Experimental analysis with data for the Ijsselmeer lead to integral optimal
solution of the linear programming relaxation of the IP model.
This naturally led to the question of integrality of the polytope associated
with the IP model.
In this paper we first give a negative answer to this question by
establishing non-integrality of the polytope.
Second, we establish natural conditions that guarantee the linear programming
relaxation of the IP model to be integral.
We then test the most recent data on flood probabilities, damage and
investment costs of the IJsselmeer for these conditions.
Third, we show that the IP model can be solved in polynomial time when the
number of dike segments, or the number of feasible barrier heights, are
constant.

"  Illegal insider trading of stocks is based on releasing non-public
information (e.g., new product launch, quarterly financial report, acquisition
or merger plan) before the information is made public. Detecting illegal
insider trading is difficult due to the complex, nonlinear, and non-stationary
nature of the stock market. In this work, we present an approach that detects
and predicts illegal insider trading proactively from large heterogeneous
sources of structured and unstructured data using a deep-learning based
approach combined with discrete signal processing on the time series data. In
addition, we use a tree-based approach that visualizes events and actions to
aid analysts in their understanding of large amounts of unstructured data.
Using existing data, we have discovered that our approach has a good success
rate in detecting illegal insider trading patterns.

calculus and the strong law of large numbers play important roles in this
scheme.

"  To convert standard Brownian motion $Z$ into a positive process, Geometric
Brownian motion (GBM) $e^{\beta Z_t}, \beta >0$ is widely used. We generalize
this positive process by introducing an asymmetry parameter $ \alpha \geq 0$
which describes the instantaneous volatility whenever the process reaches a new
low. For our new process, $\beta$ is the instantaneous volatility as prices
become arbitrarily high. Our generalization preserves the positivity, constant
proportional drift, and tractability of GBM, while expressing the instantaneous
volatility as a randomly weighted $L^2$ mean of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The
running minimum and relative drawup of this process are also analytically
tractable. Letting $\alpha = \beta$, our positive process reduces to Geometric
Brownian motion. By adding a jump to default to the new process, we introduce a
non-negative martingale with the same tractabilities. Assuming a security's
dynamics are driven by these processes in risk neutral measure, we price
several derivatives including vanilla, barrier and lookback options.

"  Due to economic globalization, each country's economic law, including tax
laws and tax treaties, has been forced to work as a single network. However,
each jurisdiction (country or region) has not made its economic law under the
assumption that its law functions as an element of one network, so it has
brought unexpected results. We thought that the results are exactly
international tax avoidance. To contribute to the solution of international tax
avoidance, we tried to investigate which part of the network is vulnerable.
Specifically, focusing on treaty shopping, which is one of international tax
avoidance methods, we attempt to identified which jurisdiction are likely to be
used for treaty shopping from tax liabilities and the relationship between
jurisdictions which are likely to be used for treaty shopping and others. For
that purpose, based on withholding tax rates imposed on dividends, interest,
and royalties by jurisdictions, we produced weighted multiple directed graphs,
computed the centralities and detected the communities. As a result, we
clarified the jurisdictions that are likely to be used for treaty shopping and
pointed out that there are community structures. The results of this study
suggested that fewer jurisdictions need to introduce more regulations for
prevention of treaty abuse worldwide.
"
"  Analyzing available FAO data from 176 countries over 21 years, we observe an
increase of complexity in the international trade of maize, rice, soy, and
wheat. A larger number of countries play a role as producers or intermediaries,
either for trade or food processing. In consequence, we find that the trade
networks become more prone to failure cascades caused by exogenous shocks. In
our model, countries compensate for demand deficits by imposing export
restrictions. To capture these, we construct higher-order trade dependency
networks for the different crops and years. These networks reveal hidden
dependencies between countries and allow to discuss policy implications.

"  We first investigate the evolution of opening and closing auctions volumes of
US equities along the years. We then report dynamical properties of pre-auction
periods: the indicative match price is strongly mean-reverting because the
imbalance is; the final auction price reacts to a single auction order
placement or cancellation in markedly different ways in the opening and closing
auctions when computed conditionally on imbalance improving or worsening
events; the indicative price reverts towards the mid price of the regular limit
order book but is not especially bound to the spread.

"  We derive a semi-analytic formula for the transition probability of
three-dimensional Brownian motion in the positive octant with absorption at the
boundaries. Separation of variables in spherical coordinates leads to an
eigenvalue problem for the resulting boundary value problem in the two angular
components. The main theoretical result is a solution to the original problem
expressed as an expansion into special functions and an eigenvalue which has to
be chosen to allow a matching of the boundary condition. We discuss and test
several computational methods to solve a finite-dimensional approximation to
this nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Finally, we apply our results to the
computation of default probabilities and credit valuation adjustments in a
structural credit model with mutual liabilities.
"
"  The Kalman Filter has been called one of the greatest inventions in
statistics during the 20th century. Its purpose is to measure the state of a
system by processing the noisy data received from different electronic sensors.
In comparison, a useful resource for managers in their effort to make the right
decisions is the wisdom of crowds. This phenomenon allows managers to combine
judgments by different employees to get estimates that are often more accurate
and reliable than estimates, which managers produce alone. Since harnessing the
collective intelligence of employees, and filtering signals from multiple noisy
sensors appear related, we looked at the possibility of using the Kalman Filter
on estimates by people. Our predictions suggest, and our findings based on the
Survey of Professional Forecasters reveal, that the Kalman Filter can help
managers solve their decision-making problems by giving them stronger signals
before they choose. Indeed, when used on a subset of forecasters identified by
the Contribution Weighted Model, the Kalman Filter beat that rule clearly,
across all the forecasting horizons in the survey.

"  We introduce the class of affine forward variance (AFV) models of which both
the conventional Heston model and the rough Heston model are special cases. We
show that AFV models can be characterized by the affine form of their cumulant
generating function, which can be obtained as solution of a convolution Riccati
equation. We further introduce the class of affine forward order flow intensity
(AFI) models, which are structurally similar to AFV models, but driven by jump
processes, and which include Hawkes-type models. We show that the cumulant
generating function of an AFI model satisfies a generalized convolution Riccati
equation and that a high-frequency limit of AFI models converges in
distribution to the AFV model.
"
"  How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify their economic
activities? How does the migration of workers among firms and industries
contribute to the diffusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry,
occupation, and location-specific knowledge carried by workers from one
establishment to the next using a dataset summarizing the individual work
history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms--firms operating in an
industry that was not present in a region--because the success of pioneers is
the basic unit of regional economic diversification. We find that the growth
and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are
workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the
same location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare
these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that
industry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than
non-pioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which
leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for
local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding
that industry-related knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of
pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of the micro-mechanisms
underlying regional economic diversification events.
"
"  We investigate the macroeconomic consequences of narrow banking in the
context of stock-flow consistent models. We begin with an extension of the
Goodwin-Keen model incorporating time deposits, government bills, cash, and
central bank reserves to the base model with loans and demand deposits and use
it to describe a fractional reserve banking system. We then characterize narrow
banking by a full reserve requirement on demand deposits and describe the
resulting separation between the payment system and lending functions of the
resulting banking sector. By way of numerical examples, we explore the
properties of fractional and full reserve versions of the model and compare
their asymptotic properties. We find that narrow banking does not lead to any
loss in economic growth when the models converge to a finite equilibrium, while
allowing for more direct monitoring and prevention of financial breakdowns in
the case of explosive asymptotic behaviour.
"
"  An accurate assessment of the risk of extreme environmental events is of
great importance for populations, authorities and the banking/insurance
industry. Koch (2017) introduced a notion of spatial risk measure and a
corresponding set of axioms which are well suited to analyze the risk due to
events having a spatial extent, precisely such as environmental phenomena. The
axiom of asymptotic spatial homogeneity is of particular interest since it
allows one to quantify the rate of spatial diversification when the region
under consideration becomes large. In this paper, we first investigate the
general concepts of spatial risk measures and corresponding axioms further. We
also explain the usefulness of this theory for the actuarial practice. Second,
in the case of a general cost field, we especially give sufficient conditions
such that spatial risk measures associated with expectation, variance,
Value-at-Risk as well as expected shortfall and induced by this cost field
satisfy the axioms of asymptotic spatial homogeneity of order 0, -2, -1 and -1,
respectively. Last but not least, in the case where the cost field is a
function of a max-stable random field, we mainly provide conditions on both the
function and the max-stable field ensuring the latter properties. Max-stable
random fields are relevant when assessing the risk of extreme events since they
appear as a natural extension of multivariate extreme-value theory to the level
of random fields. Overall, this paper improves our understanding of spatial
risk measures as well as of their properties with respect to the space variable
and generalizes many results obtained in Koch (2017).
"
"  We decompose returns for portfolios of bottom-ranked, lower-priced assets
relative to the market into rank crossovers and changes in the relative price
of those bottom-ranked assets. This decomposition is general and consistent
with virtually any asset pricing model. Crossovers measure changes in rank and
are smoothly increasing over time, while return fluctuations are driven by
volatile relative price changes. Our results imply that in a closed,
dividend-free market in which the relative price of bottom-ranked assets is
approximately constant, a portfolio of those bottom-ranked assets will
outperform the market portfolio over time. We show that bottom-ranked relative
commodity futures prices have increased only slightly, and confirm the
existence of substantial excess returns predicted by our theory. If these
excess returns did not exist, then top-ranked relative prices would have had to
be much higher in 2018 than those actually observed -- this would imply a
radically different commodity price distribution.
"
"  This paper presents a continuous-time equilibrium model of TWAP trading and
liquidity provision in a market with multiple strategic investors with
heterogeneous intraday trading targets. We solve the model in closed-form and
show there are infinitely many equilibria. We compare the competitive
equilibrium with different non-price-taking equilibria. In addition, we show
intraday TWAP benchmarking reduces market liquidity relative to just terminal
trading targets alone. The model is computationally tractable, and we provide a
number of numerical illustrations. An extension to stochastic VWAP targets is
also provided.
"
"  In this paper we propose a general framework for modeling an insurance
claims' information flow in continuous time, by generalizing the reduced-form
framework for credit risk and life insurance. In particular, we assume a
nontrivial dependence structure between the reference filtration and the
insurance internal filtration. We apply these results for pricing non-life
insurance liabilities in hybrid financial and insurance markets, while taking
into account the role of inflation under the benchmark approach. This framework
offers at the same time a general and flexible structure, and explicit and
treatable pricing formula.
"
"  Estimating covariances between financial assets plays an important role in
risk management and optimal portfolio allocation. In practice, when the sample
size is small compared to the number of variables, i.e. when considering a wide
universe of assets over just a few years, this poses considerable challenges
and the empirical estimate is known to be very unstable.
Here, we propose a novel covariance estimator based on the Gaussian Process
Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM). Our estimator can be considered as a non-linear
extension of standard factor models with readily interpretable parameters
reminiscent of market betas. Furthermore, our Bayesian treatment naturally
shrinks the sample covariance matrix towards a more structured matrix given by
the prior and thereby systematically reduces estimation errors.
"
"  We present the use of the fitted Q iteration in algorithmic trading. We show
that the fitted Q iteration helps alleviate the dimension problem that the
basic Q-learning algorithm faces in application to trading. Furthermore, we
introduce a procedure including model fitting and data simulation to enrich
training data as the lack of data is often a problem in realistic application.
We experiment our method on both simulated environment that permits arbitrage
opportunity and real-world environment by using prices of 450 stocks. In the
former environment, the method performs well, implying that our method works in
theory. To perform well in the real-world environment, the agents trained might
require more training (iteration) and more meaningful variables with predictive
value.
"
"  Aggressive incentive schemes that allow individuals to impose economic
punishment on themselves if they fail to meet health goals present a promising
approach for encouraging healthier behavior. However, the element of choice
inherent in these schemes introduces concerns that only non-representative
sectors of the population will select aggressive incentives, leaving value on
the table for those who don't opt in. In a field experiment conducted over a 29
week period on individuals wearing Fitbit activity trackers, we find modest and
short lived increases in physical activity for those provided the choice of
aggressive incentives. In contrast, we find significant and persistent
increases for those assigned (oftentimes against their stated preference) to
the same aggressive incentives. The modest benefits for those provided a choice
seems to emerge because those who benefited most from the aggressive incentives
were the least likely to choose them, and it was those who did not need them
who opted in. These results are confirmed in a follow up lab experiment. We
also find that benefits to individuals assigned to aggressive incentives were
pronounced if they also updated their step target in the Fitbit mobile
application to match the new activity goal we provided them. Our findings have
important implications for incentive based interventions to improve health
behavior. For firms and policy makers, our results suggest that one effective
strategy for encouraging sustained healthy behavior combines exposure to
aggressive incentive schemes to jolt individuals out of their comfort zones
with technology decision aids that help individuals sustain this behavior after
incentives end.
"
"  We develop a strong diagnostic for bubbles and crashes in bitcoin, by
analyzing the coincidence (and its absence) of fundamental and technical
indicators. Using a generalized Metcalfe's law based on network properties, a
fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least
four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a
universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal
pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which
parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding
and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex-ante warning of market
instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the
crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the
precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel's back) being exogenous
and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but
not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of bitcoin, suggesting many months
of volatile sideways bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March
2018).
"
"  The increasing richness in volume, and especially types of data in the
financial domain provides unprecedented opportunities to understand the stock
market more comprehensively and makes the price prediction more accurate than
before. However, they also bring challenges to classic statistic approaches
since those models might be constrained to a certain type of data. Aiming at
aggregating differently sourced information and offering type-free capability
to existing models, a framework for predicting stock market of scenarios with
mixed data, including scalar data, compositional data (pie-like) and functional
data (curve-like), is established. The presented framework is
model-independent, as it serves like an interface to multiple types of data and
can be combined with various prediction models. And it is proved to be
effective through numerical simulations. Regarding to price prediction, we
incorporate the trading volume (scalar data), intraday return series
(functional data), and investors' emotions from social media (compositional
data) through the framework to competently forecast whether the market goes up
or down at opening in the next day. The strong explanatory power of the
framework is further demonstrated. Specifically, it is found that the intraday
returns impact the following opening prices differently between bearish market
and bullish market. And it is not at the beginning of the bearish market but
the subsequent period in which the investors' ""fear"" comes to be indicative.
The framework would help extend existing prediction models easily to scenarios
with multiple types of data and shed light on a more systemic understanding of
the stock market.
"
"  Correlation networks were used to detect characteristics which, although
fixed over time, have an important influence on the evolution of prices over
time. Potentially important features were identified using the websites and
whitepapers of cryptocurrencies with the largest userbases. These were assessed
using two datasets to enhance robustness: one with fourteen cryptocurrencies
beginning from 9 November 2017, and a subset with nine cryptocurrencies
starting 9 September 2016, both ending 6 March 2018. Separately analysing the
subset of cryptocurrencies raised the number of data points from 115 to 537,
and improved robustness to changes in relationships over time. Excluding USD
Tether, the results showed a positive association between different
cryptocurrencies that was statistically significant. Robust, strong positive
associations were observed for six cryptocurrencies where one was a fork of the
other; Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash was an exception. There was evidence for the
existence of a group of cryptocurrencies particularly associated with Cardano,
and a separate group correlated with Ethereum. The data was not consistent with
a token's functionality or creation mechanism being the dominant determinants
of the evolution of prices over time but did suggest that factors other than
speculation contributed to the price.
"
"  Distributed ledger technologies rely on consensus protocols confronting
traders with random waiting times until the transfer of ownership is
accomplished. This time-consuming settlement process exposes arbitrageurs to
price risk and imposes limits to arbitrage. We derive theoretical arbitrage
boundaries under general assumptions and show that they increase with expected
latency, latency uncertainty, spot volatility, and risk aversion. Using
high-frequency data from the Bitcoin network, we estimate arbitrage boundaries
due to settlement latency of on average 124 basis points, covering 88 percent
of the observed cross-exchange price differences. Settlement through
decentralized systems thus induces non-trivial frictions affecting market
efficiency and price formation.
"
"  Barrier options are one of the most widely traded exotic options on stock
exchanges. In this paper, we develop a new stochastic simulation method for
pricing barrier options and estimating the corresponding execution
probabilities. We show that the proposed method always outperforms the standard
Monte Carlo approach and becomes substantially more efficient when the
underlying asset has high volatility, while it performs better than multilevel
Monte Carlo for special cases of barrier options and underlying assets. These
theoretical findings are confirmed by numerous simulation results.
"
"  We develop a unified valuation theory that incorporates credit risk
(defaults), collateralization and funding costs, by expanding the replication
approach to a generality that has not yet been studied previously and reaching
valuation when replication is not assumed. This unifying theoretical framework
clarifies the relationship between the two valuation approaches: the adjusted
cash flows approach pioneered for example by Brigo, Pallavicini and co-authors
([12, 13, 34]) and the classic replication approach illustrated for example by
Bielecki and Rutkowski and co-authors ([3, 8]). In particular, results of this
work cover most previous papers where the authors studied specific replication
models.
"
"  In this paper we will consider a generalized extension of the Eisenberg-Noe
model of financial contagion to allow for time dynamics in both discrete and
continuous time. Derivation and interpretation of the financial implications
will be provided. Emphasis will be placed on the continuous-time framework and
its formulation as a differential equation driven by the operating cash flows.
Mathematical results on existence and uniqueness of firm wealths under the
discrete and continuous-time models will be provided. Finally, the financial
implications of time dynamics will be considered. The focus will be on how the
dynamic clearing solutions differ from those of the static Eisenberg-Noe model.
"
"  The joint Value at Risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) quantile regression
model of Taylor (2017) is extended via incorporating a realized measure, to
drive the tail risk dynamics, as a potentially more efficient driver than daily
returns. Both a maximum likelihood and an adaptive Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo method are employed for estimation, whose properties are assessed and
compared via a simulation study; results favour the Bayesian approach, which is
subsequently employed in a forecasting study of seven market indices and two
individual assets. The proposed models are compared to a range of parametric,
non-parametric and semi-parametric models, including GARCH, Realized-GARCH and
the joint VaR and ES quantile regression models in Taylor (2017). The
comparison is in terms of accuracy of one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk and Expected
Shortfall forecasts, over a long forecast sample period that includes the
global financial crisis in 2007-2008. The results favor the proposed models
incorporating a realized measure, especially when employing the sub-sampled
Realized Variance and the sub-sampled Realized Range.
"
"  We develop a method to study the implied volatility for exotic options and
volatility derivatives with European payoffs such as VIX options. Our approach,
based on Malliavin calculus techniques, allows us to describe the properties of
the at-the-money implied volatility (ATMI) in terms of the Malliavin
derivatives of the underlying process. More precisely, we study the short-time
behaviour of the ATMI level and skew. As an application, we describe the
short-term behavior of the ATMI of VIX and realized variance options in terms
of the Hurst parameter of the model, and most importantly we describe the class
of volatility processes that generate a positive skew for the VIX implied
volatility. In addition, we find that our ATMI asymptotic formulae perform very
well even for large maturities. Several numerical examples are provided to
support our theoretical results.
"
"  Many studies have been undertaken by using machine learning techniques,
including neural networks, to predict stock returns. Recently, a method known
as deep learning, which achieves high performance mainly in image recognition
and speech recognition, has attracted attention in the machine learning field.
This paper implements deep learning to predict one-month-ahead stock returns in
the cross-section in the Japanese stock market and investigates the performance
of the method. Our results show that deep neural networks generally outperform
shallow neural networks, and the best networks also outperform representative
machine learning models. These results indicate that deep learning shows
promise as a skillful machine learning method to predict stock returns in the
cross-section.
"
"  Emerging economies frequently show a large component of their Gross Domestic
Product to be dependant on the economic activity of small and medium
enterprises. Nevertheless, e-business solutions are more likely designed for
large companies. SMEs seem to follow a classical family-based management, used
to traditional activities, rather than seeking new ways of adding value to
their business strategy. Thus, a large portion of a nations economy may be at
disadvantage for competition. This paper aims at assessing the state of
e-business readiness of Mexican SMEs based on already published e-business
evolution models and by means of a survey research design. Data is being
collected in three cities with differing sizes and infrastructure conditions.
Statistical results are expected to be presented. A second part of this
research aims at applying classical adoption models to suggest potential causal
relationships, as well as more suitable recommendations for development.
"
"  The role of portfolio construction in the implementation of equity market
neutral factors is often underestimated. Taking the classical momentum strategy
as an example, we show that one can significantly improve the main strategy's
features by properly taking care of this key step. More precisely, an optimized
portfolio construction algorithm allows one to significantly improve the Sharpe
Ratio, reduce sector exposures and volatility fluctuations, and mitigate the
strategy's skewness and tail correlation with the market. These results are
supported by long-term, world-wide simulations and will be shown to be
universal. Our findings are quite general and hold true for a number of other
""equity factors"". Finally, we discuss the details of a more realistic set-up
where we also deal with transaction costs.
"
"  We propose a novel approach for loss reserving based on deep neural networks.
The approach allows for jointly modeling of paid losses and claims outstanding,
and incorporation of heterogenous inputs. We validate the models on loss
reserving data across lines of business, and show that they attain or exceed
the predictive accuracy of existing stochastic methods. The models require
minimal feature engineering and expert input, and can be automated to produce
forecasts at a high frequency.
"
"  This paper shows how to recover stochastic volatility models (SVMs) from
market models for the VIX futures term structure. Market models have more
flexibility for fitting of curves than do SVMs, and therefore they are
better-suited for pricing VIX futures and derivatives. But the VIX itself is a
derivative of the S&P500 (SPX) and it is common practice to price SPX
derivatives using an SVM. Hence, a consistent model for both SPX and VIX
derivatives would be one where the SVM is obtained by inverting the market
model. This paper's main result is a method for the recovery of a stochastic
volatility function as the output of an inverse problem, with the inputs given
by a VIX futures market model. Analysis will show that some conditions need to
be met in order for there to not be any inter-model arbitrage or mis-priced
derivatives. Given these conditions the inverse problem can be solved. Several
models are analyzed and explored numerically to gain a better understanding of
the theory and its limitations.
"
"  Catastrophic events, though rare, do occur and when they occur, they have
devastating effects. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to understand the
complexity of the underlying dynamics and signatures of catastrophic events,
such as market crashes. For deeper understanding, we choose the US and Japanese
markets from 1985 onward, and study the evolution of the cross-correlation
structures of stock return matrices and their eigenspectra over different short
time-intervals or ""epochs"". A slight non-linear distortion is applied to the
correlation matrix computed for any epoch, leading to the emerging spectrum of
eigenvalues. The statistical properties of the emerging spectrum display: (i)
the shape of the emerging spectrum reflects the market instability, (ii) the
smallest eigenvalue may be able to statistically distinguish the nature of a
market turbulence or crisis -- internal instability or external shock, and
(iii) the time-lagged smallest eigenvalue has a statistically significant
correlation with the mean market cross-correlation. The smallest eigenvalue
seems to indicate that the financial market has become more turbulent in a
similar way as the mean does. Yet we show features of the smallest eigenvalue
of the emerging spectrum that distinguish different types of market
instabilities related to internal or external causes. Based on the paradigmatic
character of financial time series for other complex systems, the capacity of
the emerging spectrum to understand the nature of instability may be a new
feature, which can be broadly applied.
"
"  We deduce a simple closed formula for illiquid corporate coupon bond prices
when liquid bonds with similar characteristics (e.g. maturity) are present in
the market for the same issuer. The key model parameter is the
time-to-liquidate a position, i.e. the time that an experienced bond trader
takes to liquidate a given position on a corporate coupon bond.
The option approach we propose for pricing bonds' illiquidity is reminiscent
of the celebrated work of Longstaff (1995) on the non-marketability of some
non-dividend-paying shares in IPOs. This approach describes a quite common
situation in the fixed income market: it is rather usual to find issuers that,
besides liquid benchmark bonds, issue some other bonds that either are placed
to a small number of investors in private placements or have a limited issue
size.
The model considers interest rate and credit spread term structures and their
dynamics. We show that illiquid bonds present an additional liquidity spread
that depends on the time-to-liquidate aside from credit and interest rate
parameters. We provide a detailed application for two issuers in the European
market.
"
"  We describe general multilevel Monte Carlo methods that estimate the price of
an Asian option monitored at $m$ fixed dates. Our approach yields unbiased
estimators with standard deviation $O(\epsilon)$ in $O(m + (1/\epsilon)^{2})$
expected time for a variety of processes including the Black-Scholes model,
Merton's jump-diffusion model, the Square-Root diffusion model, Kou's double
exponential jump-diffusion model, the variance gamma and NIG exponential Levy
processes and, via the Milstein scheme, processes driven by scalar stochastic
differential equations. Using the Euler scheme, our approach estimates the
Asian option price with root mean square error $O(\epsilon)$ in
$O(m+(\ln(\epsilon)/\epsilon)^{2})$ expected time for processes driven by
multidimensional stochastic differential equations. Numerical experiments
confirm that our approach outperforms the conventional Monte Carlo method by a
factor of order $m$.
"
"  This paper studies the concept of instantaneous arbitrage in continuous time
and its relation to the instantaneous CAPM. Absence of instantaneous arbitrage
is equivalent to the existence of a trading strategy which satisfies the CAPM
beta pricing relation in place of the market. Thus the difference between the
arbitrage argument and the CAPM argument in Black and Scholes (1973) is this:
the arbitrage argument assumes that there exists some portfolio satisfying the
capm equation, whereas the CAPM argument assumes, in addition, that this
portfolio is the market portfolio.
"
"  The present study introduce the human capital component to the Fama and
French five-factor model proposing an equilibrium six-factor asset pricing
model. The study employs an aggregate of four sets of portfolios mimicking size
and industry with varying dimensions. The first set consists of three set of
six portfolios each sorted on size to B/M, size to investment, and size to
momentum. The second set comprises of five index portfolios, third, a four-set
of twenty-five portfolios each sorted on size to B/M, size to investment, size
to profitability, and size to momentum, and the final set constitute thirty
industry portfolios. To estimate the parameters of six-factor asset pricing
model for the four sets of variant portfolios, we use OLS and Generalized
method of moments based robust instrumental variables technique (IVGMM). The
results obtained from the relevance, endogeneity, overidentifying restrictions,
and the Hausman's specification, tests indicate that the parameter estimates of
the six-factor model using IVGMM are robust and performs better than the OLS
approach. The human capital component shares equally the predictive power
alongside the factors in the framework in explaining the variations in return
on portfolios. Furthermore, we assess the t-ratio of the human capital
component of each IVGMM estimates of the six-factor asset pricing model for the
four sets of variant portfolios. The t-ratio of the human capital of the
eighty-three IVGMM estimates are more than 3.00 with reference to the standard
proposed by Harvey et al. (2016). This indicates the empirical success of the
six-factor asset-pricing model in explaining the variation in asset returns.
"
"  We construct a continuous time model for price-mediated contagion
precipitated by a common exogenous stress to the trading book of all firms in
the financial system. In this setting, firms are constrained so as to satisfy a
risk-weight based capital ratio requirement. We use this model to find
analytical bounds on the risk-weights for an asset as a function of the market
liquidity. Under these appropriate risk-weights, we find existence and
uniqueness for the joint system of firm behavior and the asset price. We
further consider an analytical bound on the firm liquidations, which allows us
to construct exact formulas for stress testing the financial system with
deterministic or random stresses. Numerical case studies are provided to
demonstrate various implications of this model and analytical bounds.
"
"  The endogenous adaptation of agents, that may adjust their local contact
network in response to the risk of being infected, can have the perverse effect
of increasing the overall systemic infectiveness of a disease. We study a
dynamical model over two geographically distinct but interacting locations, to
better understand theoretically the mechanism at play. Moreover, we provide
empirical motivation from the Italian National Bovine Database, for the period
2006-2013.
"
"  This paper contributes a new machine learning solution for stock movement
prediction, which aims to predict whether the price of a stock will be up or
down in the near future. The key novelty is that we propose to employ
adversarial training to improve the generalization of a recurrent neural
network model. The rationality of adversarial training here is that the input
features to stock prediction are typically based on stock price, which is
essentially a stochastic variable and continuously changed with time by nature.
As such, normal training with stationary price-based features (e.g. the closing
price) can easily overfit the data, being insufficient to obtain reliable
models. To address this problem, we propose to add perturbations to simulate
the stochasticity of continuous price variable, and train the model to work
well under small yet intentional perturbations. Extensive experiments on two
real-world stock data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
solution with 3.11% relative improvements on average w.r.t. accuracy, verifying
the usefulness of adversarial training for stock prediction task. Codes will be
made available upon acceptance.
"
"  We prove limit theorems for the super-replication cost of European options in
a Binomial model with transient price impact. We show that if the time step
goes to zero and the effective resilience between consecutive trading times
remains constant then the limit of the super--replication prices coincide with
the scaling limit for temporary price impact with a modified market depth.
"
"  We propose a fast and accurate numerical method for pricing European
swaptions in multi-factor Gaussian term structure models. Our method can be
used to accelerate the calibration of such models to the volatility surface.
The pricing of an interest rate option in such a model involves evaluating a
multi-dimensional integral of the payoff of the claim on a domain where the
payoff is positive. In our method, we approximate the exercise boundary of the
state space by a hyperplane tangent to the maximum probability point on the
boundary and simplify the multi-dimensional integration into an analytical
form. The maximum probability point can be determined using the gradient
descent method. We demonstrate that our method is superior to previous methods
by comparing the results to the price obtained by numerical integration.
"
"  In this work we investigate the optimal proportional reinsurance-investment
strategy of an insurance company which wishes to maximize the expected
exponential utility of its terminal wealth in a finite time horizon. Our goal
is to extend the classical Cramer-Lundberg model introducing a stochastic
factor which affects the intensity of the claims arrival process, described by
a Cox process, as well as the insurance and reinsurance premia. Using the
classical stochastic control approach based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation we characterize the optimal strategy and provide a verification result
for the value function via classical solutions of two backward partial
differential equations. Existence and uniqueness of these solutions are
discussed. Results under various premium calculation principles are illustrated
and a new premium calculation rule is proposed in order to get more realistic
strategies and to better fit our stochastic factor model. Finally, numerical
simulations are performed to obtain sensitivity analyses.
"
"  In this paper we investigate the endogenous information contained in four
liquidity variables at a five minutes time scale on equity markets around the
world: the traded volume, the bid-ask spread, the volatility and the volume at
first limits of the orderbook. In the spirit of Granger causality, we measure
the level of information by the level of accuracy of linear autoregressive
models. This empirical study is carried out on a dataset of more than 300
stocks from four different markets (US, UK, Japan and Hong Kong) from a period
of over five years. We discuss the obtained performances of autoregressive (AR)
models on stationarized versions of the variables, focusing on explaining the
observed differences between stocks.
Since empirical studies are often conducted at this time scale, we believe it
is of paramount importance to document endogenous dynamics in a simple
framework with no addition of supplemental information. Our study can hence be
used as a benchmark to identify exogenous effects. On the other hand, most
optimal trading frameworks (like the celebrated Almgren and Chriss one), focus
on computing an optimal trading speed at a frequency close to the one we
consider. Such frameworks very often take i.i.d. assumptions on liquidity
variables; this paper document the auto-correlations emerging from real data,
opening the door to new developments in optimal trading.
"
"  We consider a class of participation rights, i.e. obligations issued by a
company to investors who are interested in performance-based compensation.
Albeit having desirable economic properties equity-based debt obligations
(EbDO) pose challenges in accounting and contract pricing. We formulate and
solve the associated mathematical problem in a discrete time, as well as a
continuous time setting. In the latter case the problem is reduced to a
forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) and solved using the
method of decoupling fields.
"
"  In this paper, we focus on option pricing models based on space-time
fractional diffusion. We briefly revise recent results which show that the
option price can be represented in the terms of rapidly converging
double-series and apply these results to the data from real markets. We focus
on estimation of model parameters from the market data and estimation of
implied volatility within the space-time fractional option pricing models.

"  This paper analyzes Airbnb listings in the city of San Francisco to better
understand how different attributes such as bedrooms, location, house type
amongst others can be used to accurately predict the price of a new listing
that optimal in terms of the host's profitability yet affordable to their
guests. This model is intended to be helpful to the internal pricing tools that
Airbnb provides to its hosts. Furthermore, additional analysis is performed to
ascertain the likelihood of a listings availability for potential guests to
consider while making a booking. The analysis begins with exploring and
examining the data to make necessary transformations that can be conducive for
a better understanding of the problem at large while helping us make
hypothesis. Moving further, machine learning models are built that are
intuitive to use to validate the hypothesis on pricing and availability and run
experiments in that context to arrive at a viable solution. The paper then
concludes with a discussion on the business implications, associated risks and
future scope.

"  We study a portfolio selection problem in a continuous-time Itô-Markov
additive market with prices of financial assets described by Markov additive
processes which combine Lévy processes and regime switching models. Thus the
model takes into account two sources of risk: the jump diffusion risk and the
regime switching risk. For this reason the market is incomplete. We complete
the market by enlarging it with the use of a set of Markovian jump securities,
Markovian power-jump securities and impulse regime switching securities.
Moreover, we give conditions under which the market is
asymptotic-arbitrage-free. We solve the portfolio selection problem in the
Itô-Markov additive market for the power utility and the logarithmic utility.

"  In a market with a rough or Markovian mean-reverting stochastic volatility
there is no perfect hedge. Here it is shown how various delta-type hedging
strategies perform and can be evaluated in such markets. A precise
characterization of the hedging cost, the replication cost caused by the
volatility fluctuations, is presented in an asymptotic regime of rapid mean
reversion for the volatility fluctuations. The optimal dynamic asset based
hedging strategy in the considered regime is identified as the so-called
`practitioners' delta hedging scheme. It is moreover shown that the
performances of the delta-type hedging schemes are essentially independent of
the regularity of the volatility paths in the considered regime and that the
hedging costs are related to a vega risk martingale whose magnitude is
proportional to a new market risk parameter.
"
"  This paper presents a widely applicable approach to solving (multi-marginal,
martingale) optimal transport and related problems via neural networks. The
core idea is to penalize the optimization problem in its dual formulation and
reduce it to a finite dimensional one which corresponds to optimizing a neural
network with smooth objective function. We present numerical examples from
optimal transport, martingale optimal transport, portfolio optimization under
uncertainty and generative adversarial networks that showcase the generality
and effectiveness of the approach.

"  We study the gap between the state pension provided by the Italian pension
system pre-Dini reform and post-Dini reform. The goal is to fill the gap
between the old and the new pension by joining a defined contribution pension
scheme and adopting an optimal investment strategy that is target-based. We
find that it is possible to cover, at least partially, this gap with the
additional income of the pension scheme, especially in the presence of late
retirement and in the presence of stagnant career. Workers with dynamic career
and workers who retire early are those who are most penalised by the reform.
Results are intuitive and in line with previous studies on the subject.

"  This paper examines the association between household healthcare expenses and
participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) when
moderated by factors associated with financial stability of households. Using a
large longitudinal panel encompassing eight years, this study finds that an
inter-temporal increase in out-of-pocket medical expenses increased the
likelihood of household SNAP participation in the current period. Financially
stable households with precautionary financial assets to cover at least 6
months worth of household expenses were significantly less likely to
participate in SNAP. The low income households who recently experienced an
increase in out of pocket medical expenses but had adequate precautionary
savings were less likely than similar households who did not have precautionary
savings to participate in SNAP. Implications for economists, policy makers, and
household finance professionals are discussed.

"  Technological parasitism is a new theory to explain the evolution of
technology in society. In this context, this study proposes a model to analyze
the interaction between a host technology (system) and a parasitic technology
(subsystem) to explain evolutionary pathways of technologies as complex
systems. The coefficient of evolutionary growth of the model here indicates the
typology of evolution of parasitic technology in relation to host technology:
i.e., underdevelopment, growth and development. This approach is illustrated
with realistic examples using empirical data of product and process
technologies. Overall, then, the theory of technological parasitism can be
useful for bringing a new perspective to explain and generalize the evolution
of technology and predict which innovations are likely to evolve rapidly in
society.
"
"  We propose a model for equity trading in a population of agents where each
agent acts to achieve his or her target stock-to-bond ratio, and, as a feedback
mechanism, follows a market adaptive strategy. In this model only a fraction of
agents participates in buying and selling stock during a trading period, while
the rest of the group accepts the newly set price. Using numerical simulations
we show that the stochastic process settles on a stationary regime for the
returns. The mean return can be greater or less than the return on the bond and
it is determined by the parameters of the adaptive mechanism. When the number
of interacting agents is fixed, the distribution of the returns follows the
log-normal density. In this case, we give an analytic formula for the mean rate
of return in terms of the rate of change of agents' risk levels and confirm the
formula by numerical simulations. However, when the number of interacting
agents per period is random, the distribution of returns can significantly
deviate from the log-normal, especially as the variance of the distribution for
the number of interacting agents increases.

"  We introduce a model for the short-term dynamics of financial assets based on
an application to finance of quantum gauge theory, developing ideas of Ilinski.
We present a numerical algorithm for the computation of the probability
distribution of prices and compare the results with APPLE stocks prices and the
S&P500 index.

"  We develop an extended multifractal analysis based on the Legendre-Fenchel
transform rather than the routinely used Legendre transform. We apply this
analysis to studying time series consisting of inter-event times. As a result,
we discern the non-monotonic behavior of the generalized Hurst exponent - the
fundamental exponent studied by us - and hence a multi-branched left-sided
spectrum of dimensions. This kind of multifractality is a direct result of the
non-monotonic behavior of the generalized Hurst exponent and is not caused by
non-analytic behavior as has been previously suggested. We examine the main
thermodynamic consequences of the existence of this type of multifractality
related to the thermal stable, metastable, and unstable phases within a
hierarchy of fluctuations, and also to the first and second order phase
transitions between them.

"  We focus on two particular aspects of model risk: the inability of a chosen
model to fit observed market prices at a given point in time (calibration
error) and the model risk due to recalibration of model parameters (in
contradiction to the model assumptions). In this context, we follow the
approach of Glasserman and Xu (2014) and use relative entropy as a pre-metric
in order to quantify these two sources of model risk in a common framework, and
consider the trade-offs between them when choosing a model and the frequency
with which to recalibrate to the market. We illustrate this approach applied to
the models of Black and Scholes (1973) and Heston (1993), using option data for
Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG). We find that recalibrating a model more
frequently simply shifts model risk from one type to another, without any
substantial reduction of aggregate model risk. Furthermore, moving to a more
complicated stochastic model is seen to be counterproductive if one requires a
high degree of robustness, for example as quantified by a 99 percent quantile
of aggregate model risk.
"
"  The paper proposes a new approach to model risk measurement based on the
Wasserstein distance between two probability measures. It formulates the
theoretical motivation resulting from the interpretation of fictitious
adversary of robust risk management. The proposed approach accounts for all
alternative models and incorporates the economic reality of the fictitious
adversary. It provides practically feasible results that overcome the
restriction and the integrability issue imposed by the nominal model. The
Wasserstein approach suits for all types of model risk problems, ranging from
the single-asset hedging risk problem to the multi-asset allocation problem.
The robust capital allocation line, accounting for the correlation risk, is not
achievable with other non-parametric approaches.
"
"  We solve the problem of optimal liquidation with volume weighted average
price (VWAP) benchmark when the market impact is linear and transient. Our
setting is indeed more general as it considers the case when the trading
interval is not necessarily coincident with the benchmark interval:
Implementation Shortfall and Target Close execution are shown to be particular
cases of our setting. We find explicit solutions in continuous and discrete
time considering risk averse investors having a CARA utility function. Finally,
we show that, contrary to what is observed for Implementation Shortfall, the
optimal VWAP solution contains both buy and sell trades also when the decay
kernel is convex.
"
"  Fractional stochastic volatility models have been widely used to capture the
non-Markovian structure revealed from financial time series of realized
volatility. On the other hand, empirical studies have identified scales in
stock price volatility: both fast-time scale on the order of days and
slow-scale on the order of months. So, it is natural to study the portfolio
optimization problem under the effects of dependence behavior which we will
model by fractional Brownian motions with Hurst index $H$, and in the fast or
slow regimes characterized by small parameters $\eps$ or $\delta$. For the
slowly varying volatility with $H \in (0,1)$, it was shown that the first order
correction to the problem value contains two terms of order $\delta^H$, one
random component and one deterministic function of state processes, while for
the fast varying case with $H > \half$, the same form holds at order
$\eps^{1-H}$. This paper is dedicated to the remaining case of a fast-varying
rough environment ($H < \half$) which exhibits a different behavior. We show
that, in the expansion, only one deterministic term of order $\sqrt{\eps}$
appears in the first order correction.
"
"  We consider a two player dynamic game played over $T \leq \infty$ periods. In
each period each player chooses any probability distribution with support on
$[0,1]$ with a given mean, where the mean is the realized value of the draw
from the previous period. The player with the highest realization in the period
achieves a payoff of $1$, and the other player, $0$; and each player seeks to
maximize the discounted sum of his per-period payoffs over the whole time
horizon. We solve for the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of this game, and
establish properties of the equilibrium strategies and payoffs in the limit.
The solution and comparative statics thereof provide insight about
intertemporal choice with status concerns. In particular we find that patient
players take fewer risks.
"
"  This paper provides a holistic study of how stock prices vary in their
response to financial disclosures across different topics. Thereby, we
specifically shed light into the extensive amount of filings for which no a
priori categorization of their content exists. For this purpose, we utilize an
approach from data mining - namely, latent Dirichlet allocation - as a means of
topic modeling. This technique facilitates our task of automatically
categorizing, ex ante, the content of more than 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings
from U.S. companies. We then evaluate the subsequent stock market reaction. Our
empirical evidence suggests a considerable discrepancy among various types of
news stories in terms of their relevance and impact on financial markets. For
instance, we find a statistically significant abnormal return in response to
earnings results and credit rating, but also for disclosures regarding business
strategy, the health sector, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Our results
yield findings that benefit managers, investors and policy-makers by indicating
how regulatory filings should be structured and the topics most likely to
precede changes in stock valuations.

"  The weak variance-alpha-gamma process is a multivariate Lévy process
constructed by weakly subordinating Brownian motion, possibly with correlated
components with an alpha-gamma subordinator. It generalises the
variance-alpha-gamma process of Semeraro constructed by traditional
subordination. We compare three calibration methods for the weak
variance-alpha-gamma process, method of moments, maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) and digital moment estimation (DME). We derive a condition for Fourier
invertibility needed to apply MLE and show in our simulations that MLE produces
a better fit when this condition holds, while DME produces a better fit when it
is violated. We also find that the weak variance-alpha-gamma process exhibits a
wider range of dependence and produces a significantly better fit than the
variance-alpha-gamma process on an S&P500-FTSE100 data set, and that DME
produces the best fit in this situation.
"
"  In this paper, we measure systematic risk with a new nonparametric factor
model, the neural network factor model. The suitable factors for systematic
risk can be naturally found by inserting daily returns on a wide range of
assets into the bottleneck network. The network-based model does not stick to a
probabilistic structure unlike parametric factor models, and it does not need
feature engineering because it selects notable features by itself. In addition,
we compare performance between our model and the existing models using 20-year
data of S&P 100 components. Although the new model can not outperform the best
ones among the parametric factor models due to limitations of the variational
inference, the estimation method used for this study, it is still noteworthy in
that it achieves the performance as best the comparable models could without
any prior knowledge.
"
"  The fundamental purpose of the present research article is to introduce the
basic principles of Dimensional Analysis in the context of the neoclassical
economic theory, in order to apply such principles to the fundamental relations
that underlay most models of economic growth. In particular, basic instruments
from Dimensional Analysis are used to evaluate the analytical consistency of
the Neoclassical economic growth model. The analysis shows that an adjustment
to the model is required in such a way that the principle of dimensional
homogeneity is satisfied.
"
"  The composition of natural liquidity has been changing over time. An analysis
of intraday volumes for the S&P500 constituent stocks illustrates that (i)
volume surprises, i.e., deviations from their respective forecasts, are
correlated across stocks, and (ii) this correlation increases during the last
few hours of the trading session. These observations could be attributed, in
part, to the prevalence of portfolio trading activity that is implicit in the
growth of ETF, passive and systematic investment strategies; and, to the
increased trading intensity of such strategies towards the end of the trading
session, e.g., due to execution of mutual fund inflows/outflows that are
benchmarked to the closing price on each day. In this paper, we investigate the
consequences of such portfolio liquidity on price impact and portfolio
execution. We derive a linear cross-asset market impact from a stylized model
that explicitly captures the fact that a certain fraction of natural liquidity
providers only trade portfolios of stocks whenever they choose to execute. We
find that due to cross-impact and its intraday variation, it is optimal for a
risk-neutral, cost minimizing liquidator to execute a portfolio of orders in a
coupled manner, as opposed to a separable VWAP-like execution that is often
assumed. The optimal schedule couples the execution of the various orders so as
to be able to take advantage of increased portfolio liquidity towards the end
of the day. A worst case analysis shows that the potential cost reduction from
this optimized execution schedule over the separable approach can be as high as
6% for plausible model parameters. Finally, we discuss how to estimate
cross-sectional price impact if one had a dataset of realized portfolio
transaction records that exploits the low-rank structure of its coefficient
matrix suggested by our analysis.
"
"  Technological improvement is the most important cause of long-term economic
growth, but the factors that drive it are still not fully understood. In
standard growth models technology is treated in the aggregate, and a main goal
has been to understand how growth depends on factors such as knowledge
production. But an economy can also be viewed as a network, in which producers
purchase goods, convert them to new goods, and sell them to households or other
producers. Here we develop a simple theory that shows how the network
properties of an economy can amplify the effects of technological improvements
as they propagate along chains of production. A key property of an industry is
its output multiplier, which can be understood as the average number of
production steps required to make a good. The model predicts that the output
multiplier of an industry predicts future changes in prices, and that the
average output multiplier of a country predicts future economic growth. We test
these predictions using data from the World Input Output Database and find
results in good agreement with the model. The results show how purely
structural properties of an economy, that have nothing to do with innovation or
human creativity, can exert an important influence on long-term growth.
"
"  Since the 1960s, the question whether markets are efficient or not is
controversially discussed. One reason for the difficulty to overcome the
controversy is the lack of a universal, but also precise, quantitative
definition of efficiency that is able to graduate between different states of
efficiency. The main purpose of this article is to fill this gap by developing
a measure for the efficiency of markets that fulfill all the stated
requirements. It is shown that the new definition of efficiency, based on
informational-entropy, is equivalent to the two most used definitions of
efficiency from Fama and Jensen. The new measure therefore enables steps to
settle the dispute over the state of efficiency in markets. Moreover, it is
shown that inefficiency in a market can either arise from the possibility to
use information to predict an event with higher than chance level, or can
emerge from wrong pricing/ quotes that do not reflect the right probabilities
of possible events. Finally, the calculation of efficiency is demonstrated on a
simple game (of coin tossing), to show how one could exactly quantify the
efficiency in any market-like system, if all probabilities are known.
"
"  The main purpose of this paper is to formalize the modelling process,
analysis and mathematical definition of corruption when entering into a
contract between principal agent and producers. The formulation of the problem
and the definition of concepts for the general case are considered. For
definiteness, all calculations and formulas are given for the case of three
producers, one principal agent and one intermediary. Economic analysis of
corruption allowed building a mathematical model of interaction between agents.
Financial resources distribution problem in a contract with a corrupted
intermediary is considered.Then proposed conditions for corruption emergence
and its possible consequences. Optimal non-corruption schemes of financial
resources distribution in a contract are formed, when principal agent's choice
is limited first only by asymmetrical information and then also by external
influences.Numerical examples suggesting optimal corruption-free agents'
behaviour are presented.
"
"  In this work, we propose a model for estimating volatility from financial
time series, extending the non-Gaussian family of space-state models with exact
marginal likelihood proposed by Gamerman, Santos and Franco (2013). On the
literature there are models focused on estimating financial assets risk,
however, most of them rely on MCMC methods based on Metropolis algorithms,
since full conditional posterior distributions are not known. We present an
alternative model capable of estimating the volatility, in an automatic way,
since all full conditional posterior distributions are known, and it is
possible to obtain an exact sample of parameters via Gibbs Sampler. The
incorporation of jumps in returns allows the model to capture speculative
movements of the data, so that their influence does not propagate to
volatility. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using synthetic and
real data time series.
Keywords: Financial time series, Stochastic volatility, Gibbs Sampler,
Dynamic linear models.

"  We provide an asymptotic expansion of the value function of a
multidimensional utility maximization problem from consumption with small
non-linear price impact. In our model cross-impacts between assets are allowed.
In the limit for small price impact, we determine the asymptotic expansion of
the value function around its frictionless version. The leading order
correction is characterized by a nonlinear second order PDE related to an
ergodic control problem and a linear parabolic PDE. We illustrate our result on
a multivariate geometric Brownian motion price model.

"  We study the optimal investment-consumption problem for a member of defined
contribution plan during the decumulation phase. For a fixed annuitization
time, to achieve higher final annuity, we consider a variable consumption rate.
Moreover, to eliminate the ruin possibilities and having a minimum guarantee
for the final annuity, we consider a safety level for the wealth process which
consequently yields a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation on a bounded
domain. We apply the policy iteration method to find approximations of solution
of the HJB equation. Finally, we give the simulation results for the optimal
investment-consumption strategies, optimal wealth process and the final annuity
for different ranges of admissible consumptions. Furthermore, by calculating
the present market value of the future cash flows before and after the
annuitization, we compare the results for different consumption policies.

"  The increasing availability of ""big"" (large volume) social media data has
motivated a great deal of research in applying sentiment analysis to predict
the movement of prices within financial markets. Previous work in this field
investigates how the true sentiment of text (i.e. positive or negative
opinions) can be used for financial predictions, based on the assumption that
sentiments expressed online are representative of the true market sentiment.
Here we consider the converse idea, that using the stock price as the
ground-truth in the system may be a better indication of sentiment. Tweets are
labelled as Buy or Sell dependent on whether the stock price discussed rose or
fell over the following hour, and from this, stock-specific dictionaries are
built for individual companies. A Bayesian classifier is used to generate stock
predictions, which are input to an automated trading algorithm. Placing 468
trades over a 1 month period yields a return rate of 5.18%, which annualises to
approximately 83% per annum. This approach performs significantly better than
random chance and outperforms two baseline sentiment analysis methods tested.

"  Most sales applications are characterized by competition and limited demand
information. For successful pricing strategies, frequent price adjustments as
well as anticipation of market dynamics are crucial. Both effects are
challenging as competitive markets are complex and computations of optimized
pricing adjustments can be time-consuming. We analyze stochastic dynamic
pricing models under oligopoly competition for the sale of perishable goods. To
circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we propose a heuristic approach to
efficiently compute price adjustments. To demonstrate our strategy's
applicability even if the number of competitors is large and their strategies
are unknown, we consider different competitive settings in which competitors
frequently and strategically adjust their prices. For all settings, we verify
that our heuristic strategy yields promising results. We compare the
performance of our heuristic against upper bounds, which are obtained by
optimal strategies that take advantage of perfect price anticipations. We find
that price adjustment frequencies can have a larger impact on expected profits
than price anticipations. Finally, our approach has been applied on Amazon for
the sale of used books. We have used a seller's historical market data to
calibrate our model. Sales results show that our data-driven strategy
outperforms the rule-based strategy of an experienced seller by a profit
increase of more than 20%.

"  --- the companies populating a Stock market, along with their connections,
can be effectively modeled through a directed network, where the nodes
represent the companies, and the links indicate the ownership. This paper deals
with this theme and discusses the concentration of a market. A
cross-shareholding matrix is considered, along with two key factors: the node
out-degree distribution which represents the diversification of investments in
terms of the number of involved companies, and the node in-degree distribution
which reports the integration of a company due to the sales of its own shares
to other companies. While diversification is widely explored in the literature,
integration is most present in literature on contagions. This paper captures
such quantities of interest in the two frameworks and studies the stochastic
dependence of diversification and integration through a copula approach. We
adopt entropies as measures for assessing the concentration in the market. The
main question is to assess the dependence structure leading to a better
description of the data or to market polarization (minimal entropy) or market
fairness (maximal entropy). In so doing, we derive information on the way in
which the in- and out-degrees should be connected in order to shape the market.
The question is of interest to regulators bodies, as witnessed by specific
alert threshold published on the US mergers guidelines for limiting the
possibility of acquisitions and the prevalence of a single company on the
market. Indeed, all countries and the EU have also rules or guidelines in order
to limit concentrations, in a country or across borders, respectively. The
calibration of copulas and model parameters on the basis of real data serves as
an illustrative application of the theoretical proposal.

"  Identifying meaningful signal buried in noise is a problem of interest
arising in diverse scenarios of data-driven modeling. We present here a
theoretical framework for exploiting intrinsic geometry in data that resists
noise corruption, and might be identifiable under severe obfuscation. Our
approach is based on uncovering a valid complete inner product on the space of
ergodic stationary finite valued processes, providing the latter with the
structure of a Hilbert space on the real field. This rigorous construction,
based on non-standard generalizations of the notions of sum and scalar
multiplication of finite dimensional probability vectors, allows us to
meaningfully talk about ""angles"" between data streams and data sources, and,
make precise the notion of orthogonal stochastic processes. In particular, the
relative angles appear to be preserved, and identifiable, under severe noise,
and will be developed in future as the underlying principle for robust
classification, clustering and unsupervised featurization algorithms.
"
"  Inspired by recent work of P.-L. Lions on conditional optimal control, we
introduce a problem of optimal stopping under bounded rationality: the
objective is the expected payoff at the time of stopping, conditioned on
another event. For instance, an agent may care only about states where she is
still alive at the time of stopping, or a company may condition on not being
bankrupt. We observe that conditional optimization is time-inconsistent due to
the dynamic change of the conditioning probability and develop an equilibrium
approach in the spirit of R. H. Strotz' work for sophisticated agents in
discrete time. Equilibria are found to be essentially unique in the case of a
finite time horizon whereas an infinite horizon gives rise to non-uniqueness
and other interesting phenomena. We also introduce a theory which generalizes
the classical Snell envelope approach for optimal stopping by considering a
pair of processes with Snell-type properties.

"  This research aims to identify how Bitcoin-related news publications and
online discourse are expressed in Bitcoin exchange movements of price and
volume. Being inherently digital, all Bitcoin-related fundamental data (from
exchanges, as well as transactional data directly from the blockchain) is
available online, something that is not true for traditional businesses or
currencies traded on exchanges. This makes Bitcoin an interesting subject for
such research, as it enables the mapping of sentiment to fundamental events
that might otherwise be inaccessible. Furthermore, Bitcoin discussion largely
takes place on online forums and chat channels. In stock trading, the value of
sentiment data in trading decisions has been demonstrated numerous times [1]
[2] [3], and this research aims to determine whether there is value in such
data for Bitcoin trading models. To achieve this, data over the year 2015 has
been collected from Bitcointalk.org, (the biggest Bitcoin forum in post
volume), established news sources such as Bloomberg and the Wall Street
Journal, the complete /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin subreddits, and the bitcoin-otc and
bitcoin-dev IRC channels. By analyzing this data on sentiment and volume, we
find weak to moderate correlations between forum, news, and Reddit sentiment
and movements in price and volume from 1 to 5 days after the sentiment was
expressed. A Granger causality test confirms the predictive causality of the
sentiment on the daily percentage price and volume movements, and at the same
time underscores the predictive causality of market movements on sentiment
expressions in online communities

"  In the seminal work [9], several macroscopic market observables have been
introduced, in an attempt to find characteristics capturing the diversity of a
financial market. Despite the crucial importance of such observables for
investment decisions, a concise mathematical description of their dynamics has
been missing. We fill this gap in the setting of rank-based models and expect
our ideas to extend to other models of large financial markets as well. The
results are then used to study the performance of multiplicatively and
additively functionally generated portfolios, in particular, over short-term
and medium-term horizons.
"
"  We review recent progress in modeling credit risk for correlated assets. We
start from the Merton model which default events and losses are derived from
the asset values at maturity. To estimate the time development of the asset
values, the stock prices are used whose correlations have a strong impact on
the loss distribution, particularly on its tails. These correlations are
non-stationary which also influences the tails. We account for the asset
fluctuations by averaging over an ensemble of random matrices that models the
truly existing set of measured correlation matrices. As a most welcome side
effect, this approach drastically reduces the parameter dependence of the loss
distribution, allowing us to obtain very explicit results which show
quantitatively that the heavy tails prevail over diversification benefits even
for small correlations. We calibrate our random matrix model with market data
and show how it is capable of grasping different market situations.
Furthermore, we present numerical simulations for concurrent portfolio risks,
i.e., for the joint probability densities of losses for two portfolios. For the
convenience of the reader, we give an introduction to the Wishart random matrix
model.

"  Functions or 'functionnings' enable to give a structure to any economic
activity whether they are used to describe a good or a service that is
exchanged on a market or they constitute the capability of an agent to provide
the labor market with specific work and skills. That structure encompasses the
basic law of supply and demand and the conditions of growth within a
transaction and of the inflation control. Functional requirements can be
followed from the design of a product to the delivery of a solution to a
customer needs with different levels of externalities while value is created
integrating organizational and technical constraints whereas a budget is
allocated to the various entities of the firm involved in the production.
Entering the market through that structure leads to designing basic equations
of its dynamics and to finding canonical solutions out of particular
equilibria. This approach enables to tackle behavioral foundations of Prospect
Theory within a generalization of its probability weighting function turned
into an operator which applies to Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and
Democratic societies as well as to the poorest ones. The nature of reality and
well-being appears then as closely related to the relative satisfaction reached
on the market, as it can be conceived by an agent, according to business
cycles. This reality being the result of the complementary systems that govern
human mind as structured by rational psychologists.

"  In this paper, we study a stochastic optimal control problem with stochastic
volatility. We prove the sufficient and necessary maximum principle for the
proposed problem. Then we apply the results to solve an investment, consumption
and life insurance problem with stochastic volatility, that is, we consider a
wage earner investing in one risk-free asset and one risky asset described by a
jump-diffusion process and has to decide concerning consumption and life
insurance purchase. We assume that the life insurance for the wage earner is
bought from a market composed of $M>1$ life insurance companies offering
pairwise distinct life insurance contracts. The goal is to maximize the
expected utilities derived from the consumption, the legacy in the case of a
premature death and the investor's terminal wealth.

"  We present a new methodology of computing incremental contribution for
performance ratios for portfolio like Sharpe, Treynor, Calmar or Sterling
ratios. Using Euler's homogeneous function theorem, we are able to decompose
these performance ratios as a linear combination of individual modified
performance ratios. This allows understanding the drivers of these performance
ratios as well as deriving a condition for a new asset to provide incremental
performance for the portfolio. We provide various numerical examples of this
performance ratio decomposition.

"  The QLBS model is a discrete-time option hedging and pricing model that is
based on Dynamic Programming (DP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). It combines
the famous Q-Learning method for RL with the Black-Scholes (-Merton) model's
idea of reducing the problem of option pricing and hedging to the problem of
optimal rebalancing of a dynamic replicating portfolio for the option, which is
made of a stock and cash. Here we expand on several NuQLear (Numerical
Q-Learning) topics with the QLBS model. First, we investigate the performance
of Fitted Q Iteration for a RL (data-driven) solution to the model, and
benchmark it versus a DP (model-based) solution, as well as versus the BSM
model. Second, we develop an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) setting for
the model, where we only observe prices and actions (re-hedges) taken by a
trader, but not rewards. Third, we outline how the QLBS model can be used for
pricing portfolios of options, rather than a single option in isolation, thus
providing its own, data-driven and model independent solution to the (in)famous
volatility smile problem of the Black-Scholes model.

"  Foundations of equilibrium thermodynamics are the equation of state (EoS) and
four postulated laws of thermodynamics. We use equilibrium thermodynamics
paradigms in constructing the EoS for microeconomics system that is a market.
This speculation is hoped to be first step towards whole pictures of
thermodynamical paradigm of economics.

"  We consider a fractional version of the Heston volatility model which is
inspired by [16]. Within this model we treat portfolio optimization problems
for power utility functions. Using a suitable representation of the fractional
part, followed by a reasonable approximation we show that it is possible to
cast the problem into the classical stochastic control framework. This approach
is generic for fractional processes. We derive explicit solutions and obtain as
a by-product the Laplace transform of the integrated volatility. In order to
get rid of some undesirable features we introduce a new model for the rough
path scenario which is based on the Marchaud fractional derivative. We provide
a numerical study to underline our results.
